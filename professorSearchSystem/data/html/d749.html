<H2>Biographical Information</H2> 

<P>
Professor Lawrence A. Rowe retired from the University in 
June 2003 after twenty-seven 
years to pursue projects involving the development of streaming media 
software, consulting with multimedia research laboratories, and 
investing in startup companies.
He was the founding director of the Berkeley Multimedia 
Research Center (BMRC), which was created in 1995 to
explore the application of multimedia technology including streaming
media and web-based interactive titles to education and research.
BMRC taught classes on multimedia authoring, established and operated 
authoring studios and distributed collaboration and distance learning
rooms and services, and provided advice and technical support on a wide range 
of issues relating to multimedia authoring and distributed collaboration.
BMRC closed in 2002 due to a lack of funding and support.
</P><P>

Professor Rowe headed the research group that produced 
the Berkeley MPEG-1 Tools,
the Berkeley Multimedia, Interfaces, and Graphics (MIG) Seminar Internet 
webcast, and the Open Mash Streaming Media Toolkit. He was also responsible 
for the development and deployment of the Berkeley lecture webcasting system.
Earlier in his career he worked on database application development tools and 
technologies that were later commercialized by Ingres Corporation.
</P><P>
He received a BA degree in Mathematics and a PhD in 
Information and Computer Science from the University of California at 
Irvine in 1970 and 1976, respectively. 
He is a Fellow of the ACM, past chair of the ACM Special Interest Group 
on Multimedia, and has served on many governmental advisory committees.
</P><P>
Professor Rowe has consulted with and served on the Technical Adivsory
Boards of numerous companies, co-founded several companies including 
Ingres Corporation, NCast Corporation, and Orinda Software, Inc., and 
served on the Board of Directors of Ingres Corporation, NCast Corporation,
and Siemens Technology-to-Business.

<H2>Miscellaneous Information</H2>

<LI>
The <a href="http://www.bmrc.berkeley.edu/">BMRC website</a> continues to 
exist but most of the titles, including the streaming media lectures 
are no longer operational.  Archives of selected past class websites, 
project descriptions, publications, instructional guides, and software are 
still available at the website.  However, the site is not being maintained
or updated.
</LI>
<LI><i>Open Mash Streaming Media Toolkit</i> -
Several people, including me, continue to develop the
Open Mash Streaming Media Toolkit created by Steve McCanne
when he was on the Berkeley faculty.  
The <a href="http://www.openmash.org/">Open
Mash website</a>, the source management and distribution system, and the
various mailing lists continue to operate.  See the website for recent
announcements about new features added to the system. We are currently
working to produce a stable Version 5.3 general release.
</LI>
<LI><i>Berkeley MPEG-1 Video Tools</i> -
We developed the <a href="http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/mpeg">tools</a> back 
in the early 1990's to assess the suitable of desktop
computers for software encoding and decoding MPEG video. These
tools included the first widely distributed MPEG-1 video decoder
(<tt>mpeg_play</tt>), encoder (<tt>mpeg_encode</tt>), and several tools to
analyze how a particular video was encoded. We do not support these tools,
but they continue to be popular for reasons at which I can only guess.
Most desktop systems have better players and encoders available, but you
are welcome to do with the code whatever you want. We published several 
papers describing the software including benchmarks on systems available
at the time and recently completed a 

<a
href="http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/research/publications/2004/169/04mpeg-preprint.pdf">revision of the original 1993 ACM
Multimedia Conference paper</a> that will appear in the first issue of
the new <a href="http://www.acm.org/tomccap/">ACM Transactions on 
Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications</a> in early 2005.
</LI>
<LI><i>Berkeley Lecture Webcasts (BIBS System)</i> -
We began regularly schedule webcasts of the 
<a href="http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/courseware/cs298/">Berkeley MIG Seminar</a>
in January 1995 and continued every week through December 2002 except for
Academic Year 2001-2 when I was on sabbatical.  We still have all the video
tapes and the digitized lectures. I am hoping at some point in the future 
to produce a DVD with the "greatest hits" lectures from the series.
Sadly, both the MIG Seminar and the class lectures we produced with the
Berkeley Internet Broadcasting System (BIBS) from Fall 1998 semester
through the Spring 2001 semester are no longer accessible. The software
used several servers (see the 
<a href="http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/bibs-report/">BIBS Report</a> for a
description of the system architecture), and it is too difficult to keep
them running with all the maintenance required in our modern spam and virus
infested Internet.
The system was transfered to 
<a href="http://ets.berkeley.edu/">Educational Technology Services</a>, 
which is a campus support organization on the Berkeley campus.
