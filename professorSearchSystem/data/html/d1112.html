<li><strong>Title</strong>: Open problems and recent advances in deep learning theory: representation, generalization, and optimization</li>
<li><strong>Abstract</strong>: This talk will survey recent progress in deep learning theory, with a focus on three specific results. First is a representation result: there exist deep networks which can be approximated by shallow networks only if they have exponentially as many nodes. Secondly, standard generalization tools will be adapted to deep networks by being sensitive to not just the data and the class of predictors, but also their relationship to the training algorithm (gradient descent). Lastly, preliminary results on deep network optimization will be presented for the special case of deep linear networks.</li>

<li><strong>Title</strong>: Deep Learning in Transportation</li>
<li><strong>Abstract</strong>: In this talk, I introduce an urban taxi demand forecast problem using deep learning. Two deep neural networks for taxi demand predictions are compared, i.e., the ST-ResNet and FLC-Net, on NYC taxi trip record dataset. Our experimental results show that DNN outperforms most traditional machine learning techniques, but such superior results can only be achieved with proper design of the DNN architecture, where domain knowledge plays a key role.</li>

<p>Assistant Professor of Computer Science, Columbia University</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: Building Verifiably Secure Machine Learning Systems</li>
<li><strong>Abstract</strong>: Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly deployed in safety- and security-critical domains including self-driving cars and malware detection, where the correctness and predictability of a system’s behavior for corner case inputs are of great importance. However, state-of-the-art ML systems, despite their impressive capabilities, often have unexpected/incorrect behaviors in corner cases as demonstrated by the recent fatal collision involving Tesla’s autopilot system. Unfortunately, traditional software verification techniques are not well-suited for modern ML systems like deep neural networks. In this talk, I will describe new approaches to developing efficient systematic verification techniques that can ensure the safety and security of real-world systems using deep neural networks.</li>

<li><strong>Title</strong>: Tracking objects and fields in videos using deep learning</li>
<li><strong>Abstract</strong>: Many visually observable phenomena contain details of importance which need to be tracked in position and/or appearance. We have been investigating two topics of practical value which require tracking in video recordings - the measurement of peripheral edema and the estimation of trajectories of multiple objects in a busy traffic intersection. We overview video-preprocessing and deep learning techniques which we have deployed for these two problems. Whereas preliminary results are promising, both projects now require significant increase in the number of reliably-labeled ground truth samples. We discuss issues that we are tackling in acquiring new data for these two problems - one in a medical outpatient setting, and the other in the context of project COSMOS.</li>

<h3 id="paul-sajda"><a href="http://liinc.bme.columbia.edu/">Paul Sajda</a></h3>
<p>Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Radiology (Physics) and Electrical Engineering, Columbia University</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: Deep Learning for Fusion and Inference in Multimodal Neuroimaging</li>
<li><strong>Abstract</strong>: TBD</li>
<li><strong>Bio</strong>: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiology (Physics) at Columbia University. He is also a Member of Columbia’s Data Science Institute. Sajda is interested in what happens in our brains when we make a rapid decision and, conversely, what processes and representations in our brains drive our underlying preferences and choices, particularly when we are under time pressure. His work in understanding the basic principles of rapid decision-making in the human brain relies on measuring human subject behavior simultaneously with cognitive and physiological state. Important in his approach is his use of machine learning and data analytics to fuse these measurements for predicting behavior and infer brain responses to stimuli. Sajda applies the basic principles he uncovers to construct real-time brain-computer interfaces that are aimed at improving interactions between humans and machines. He is also applying his methodology to understand how deficits in rapid decision-making may underlie and be diagnostic of many types of psychiatric diseases and mental illnesses. Of particular interest to Sajda is how different areas in the human brain interact to change our arousal state and modulate our decision-making. Specifically he is using simultaneous EEG and fMRI together with pupillometry to identify and track spatiotemporal interactions between the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and subcortical nuclei such as the locus coeruleus. He has found that the dynamics of these interactions are altered under stress, particularly when dealing with high-pressure decisions with critical performance boundaries. These findings are being transitioned to applications ranging from to tracking pilot cognitive state while operating fighter aircraft to identifying biomarkers of healthy thought patterns in patients being treated for major depressive disorder and/or complicated grief. Sajda is a co-founder of several neurotechnology companies and works closely with a range of scientists and engineers, including neuroscientists, psychologists, computer scientists, and clinicians.</li>

<li><strong>Title</strong>: Recent Advances in AI and ML Hardware Design</li>
<li><strong>Abstract</strong>: Computing technology has been a backbone of our society. Its importance is hard to overemphasize. Today, we again confirm its extreme importance with recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning. Those emerging workloads impose an unprecedented amount of arithmetic complexity and data access beyond our existing computing systems can barely handle. Across the computing systems from data centers, to mobile, and to extreme implants will face a major challenge in achieving short computational delay, energy-efficiency, and accuracy for truly enabling intelligent systems. In this seminar, we will outline the bottlenecks, notably the end of the Moore’s Law and the memory wall problem. We will then discuss several approaches that our group has been working on, including in-memory computing, analog mixed-signal (AMS) feature extraction, and algorithm-hardware optimization. We will introduce several test-chip prototypes and their measurement results.</li>

<li><strong>Title</strong>: NimbleMiner: a user driven multi-lingual approach to healthcare text mining with deep learning</li>
<li><strong>Abstract</strong>: Background: Massive amounts of important clinical data are captured as text narratives within electronic health records. These narrative data require innovative tools that help clinicians and researchers to extract meaning. Natural language processing (NLP) is a set of powerful techniques that can help in processing and deriving meaning from clinical narratives. However, for nursing and allied health professions NLP development and implementation remains relatively poor. We developed and conducted several case studies evaluating an open source software called NimbleMiner that allows clinicians to create rapid NLP solutions to extract concepts of interest from clinical narratives in mulptiple languages (indulging English, Hebrew and Russian). The presentation will demonstrate the software architecture and share the results of several promising case studies. Methods: NimbleMiner is built to help users (clinicians and/or researchers) interact with word embedding language models (skip-gram models- word2vec) while creating and refining predictive models to identify a concepts of interest in clinical narratives. These clinical narratives might include inpatient nursing notes, homecare visit notes, discharge summaries, among others. First, NimbleMiner allows users rapidly create vocabularies of clinical terms within a particular area of interest (e.g., identify words and expressions describing fall history or alcohol abuse). Next, NimbleMiner applies the resulting vocabulary terms to identify and label the positive cases, (positive cases are defined as clinical notes where the concept of interest is described). NimbleMiner creates a training set of notes on which a machine learning predictive models are developed. Finally, the resulting machine learning model can be applied to generate predictions for new (unknown) notes. Results: We conducted several studies where NimbleMiner was compared with other NLP systems. For example, NimbleMiner was successfully used to identify fall-related information in homecare visit notes, find alcohol abuse instances in hospital discharge summaries and identify several diseases in hospital notes in Hebrew (including diabetes, heart failure, etc.). In most projects, NimbleMiner outperformed traditional NLP systems in terms of system accuracy and showed less time needed for NLP implementation. Conclusions: We developed an open access NLP system for rapid clinician-driven machine learning of clinical narratives in multiple languages. The presentation will demonstrate the application and encourage participants to make use of the important previously underutilized narrative clinical data.</li>
