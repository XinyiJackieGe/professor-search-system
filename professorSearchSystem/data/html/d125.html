Expertise</h2>
<p class="style7">
Cloud computing, distributed big-data management and analysis, data stream 
processing, data-driven science<p class="style7">
<strong>Research collaborations</strong>: I have been collaborating with 
industrial partners and with scientists from various disciplines since 1999. 
While specific challenges vary, there is always the same common theme: everybody 
is collecting and generating an ever 
increasing amount of data. In this world of big data and of data-driven science, 
groundbreaking discoveries depend on the ability to efficiently analyze and 
process these massive amounts of data. We have been designing scalable data 
management and analysis techniques for neuroscience, discovery and linking of 
personal information (e.g., as mandated by GDPR), ornithology, ecology, rocket 
science (really!), astronomy, and high-energy physics---to name a few.<h2 class="style7">Research</h2>
<p class="style7"><strong>Research vision</strong>: Create algorithms that <em>
scale</em> in the size and complexity of data, with a focus on analysis problems 
motivated by grand challenges in Open Data and data-driven science.</p>
<p class="style7"><strong>What our PhD students do</strong>: design novel 
algorithms; prove lower bounds, upper bonds, optimality; build big-data systems; 
publish results in the premier CS and domain-science venues.</p>

<img alt="DATA Lab @ Northeastern logo" height="40" src="images/DataLab-all-small.png" width="94" class="auto-style1" style="float: left" />Prof. Riedewald is co-founder and co-leader of the
<a href="https://db.khoury.northeastern.edu/">DATA Lab</a> @ Northeastern. 
Currently he focuses on the development of novel techniques for 
large-scale distributed data analysis, data management, and data mining. His 
research agenda is driven by collaborations with domain scientists and industry, 
with the goal to produce results that are publishable in both premier computer 
science venues as well as those in the application domain.<h3 class="style7"><a href="publications.htm">Publications</a></h3>
<h3 class="style7">Current Projects</h3>
<h4 class="style7">Scalable Big-Data Analytics</h4>
<p class="style7">How do we effectively and efficiently use many machines in a 
cluster or in a cloud to solve a big-data-analysis challenge? What is the best 
way to partition a dataset so that running time of the distributed computation 
is minimized? How do we abstract a complex distributed computation so that we 
can learn a mathematical model of how running time depends on parameters 
affecting data partitioning?</p>
<h4 class="style7"><a href="Projects/NCTracerWeb/index.htm">NCTracer Web</a></h4>
<p class="style7">How do we turn 20,000 3D image stacks (10 terabytes per mouse 
brain) taken by a high-resolution light microscope into a coherent 3D image of 
the brain? How do we extract from this massive dataset a graph representing the 
neurons captured in the image? And how do we analyze this graph efficiently? Can 
we extend this approach to include other brain data, e.g., from fMRI and 
electron microscopes? And can we generalize our techniques to graph problems in 
other domains such as social network analysis?</p>
<h4 class="style7">Fast Ranked Retrieval of Massive Query Results</h4>
<p class="style7">When a query on big data produces huge output, can we quickly 
return the &quot;most important&quot; results without even computing the entire output? If 
the notion of importance is difficult to define, can we return the top-ranked 
results so quickly that the user can try out different options (nearly) 
interactively? For what types of queries and data can this functionality be 
supported? And what are the best worst-case time and space guarantees we can 
provide?</p>
