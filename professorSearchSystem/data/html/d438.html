                  Zilberstein</a>. My research interests include Artificial                Intelligence, Robotics, Multi-Agent and Multi-Robot Systems,                Reasoning Under Uncertainty, Game Theory and Machine Learning. </p>              <p class="serifFont">My research explores principled solution                methods for systems of agents (e.g., robots, network nodes,                sensors, people) with uncertainty and limited communication. As                agents are built for more complex environments, engineering                solutions by hand becomes very difficult, while methods based on                formal models can automatically generate high-quality solutions.                Many real-world scenarios have some communication cost, latency                or noise (e.g., disaster response, networking, coordination over                large distances). Due to these communication limitations, agents                that can make decisions on their own are critical. My research                seeks to develop fundamental theory as well as scalable                algorithms that provide this high-quality autonomy in real-world                systems such as multi-robot navigation, search and rescue and                surveillance problems.</p>              <hr>              <h3>Press:</h3>              Much of my work focuses on robotics, and I'm very interested in              using my work for real-world applications.
