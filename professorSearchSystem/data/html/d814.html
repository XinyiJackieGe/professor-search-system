Michael A. Lieberman received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1962 and his Ph.D. degree from
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966.  He joined the <a
href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/EE/">Department of Electrical
Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS)</a> at Berkeley in 1966.  In
1971, he received the Distinguished Teaching Award of the Berkeley
campus.  He was a Guggenheim Fellow during 1972-3. He is a Fellow of
the American Physical Society (APS), the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS), the Institute of Electrical and
Electronic Engineers (IEEE), the American Vacuum Society,
the Institute of Physics (Great Britain), and the International
Plasma Chemistry Society.
He received the IEEE Plasma Science and
Applications Award in 1995, the von Engel Prize of the
International Union of Pure and Applied Physics in 2005, and the American
Physical Society Will Allis Prize for Study of Ionized Gases in 2006.


<p>
Professor Lieberman's research interests are plasma processing of
materials, plasma modeling and diagnostics. He has also collaborated with
<a href="http://hera.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ajl"> Prof. A.J.
Lichtenberg</a> on research in nonlinear dynamics. His monograph,
co-authored with A.J. Lichtenberg, <i>Regular and Stochastic
Motion</i>, was published by Springer-Verlag in 1983. A second
edition, <a
href="Textbook1.html"><i>Regular and
Chaotic Dynamics,</i></a> was published in 1991. His latest book, also
co-authored with A.J. Lichtenberg, <a
href="Textbook2.html">
<i>Principles of Plasma Discharges and Materials Processing,</i></a> was
published by John Wiley and Sons in 1994.  An expanded
second edition was published in 2005, a Chinese language edition
in 2007, and a Japanese language edition in 2010.
Erratas for both the first and second editions are available (see above):
