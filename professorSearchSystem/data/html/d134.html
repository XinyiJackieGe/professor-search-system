<!--h3>Welcome!</h3-->
<p>I am an associate professor in the Khoury College of Computer
Sciences at Northeastern University, and a member of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute. 
    My research is primarily in the areas of distributed systems and
networking, with a recent focus on privacy, security, transparency, and mobile systems.     
</p>
<p>
    My research approach is to combine science and engineering to understand and improve the performance, reliability, and security of Internet systems. With respect to science, I empirically measure computer systems that interact over the Internet to understand how well they match existing models and assumptions, then investigate the root causes for violations of those models/assumptionsâ€”often then leading to the design of new models. In many cases, our observations also suggest the design of systems that exploit previously unknown information about how our Internet-enabled systems work, and as an engineer I build and evaluate such systems in a way that other researchers, users, and policy makers can benefit from the result. To date, the software artifacts of my research have more than one million users, and my research teams have produced reports and datasets that informed additional research, policy debates, regulators, and legislators. 
</p>
<h3>News</h3>
<ul>
    <!--li><span class="label label-info">Prospective students!</span> I am currently 
  looking to admit Ph.D. students starting in the <b>Fall 2020</b>. Please see <a href="join.php">this page</a> 
  for more information. I am particularly interested in researchers at the intersection of privacy, security and networking, and are interested in projects involving mobile and IoT systems. 
        Also, I am always on the lookout for Northeastern MS and undergraduate students   
  who are interested in privacy, security, net neutrality, and building mobile systems.</li-->
    <li><span class="label label-success">2/20/20</span> Happy to announce that <a href="pubs/flowprint_ndss20.pdf">FlowPrint</a> will appear in NDSS 2020! This project focuses on an approach to fingerprinting apps based ono network traffic that works both in semi-supervised and entirely unsuperrvised settings. This is joint work led by Thijs van Ede, along with Riccardo Bortolameotti, Andrea Continella, Jingjing Ren, Daniel Dubois, Martina Lindorfer, Maarten van Steen, Andreas Peter.
    <li><span class="label label-success">7/19/19</span> Very excited to report that two papers I coauthored will appear at <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2019/">IMC 2019</a>. 
        <ul>
            <li>In <b>Information Exposure From Consumer IoT Devices: A Multidimensional, Network-Informed Measurement Approach</b>, led by my recently graduated PhD student Dr. Jingjing Ren, we conduct a multidimensional analysis of privacy exposure from 81 devices located in labs in the US and UK, using more than 34,000 automated and manual experiments. We characterize privacy exposure in terms of destinations of Internet traffic, whether the contents of communication are protected by encryption, what are the IoT-device interactions that each destination learns about, and whether there are unexpected exposures of sensitive information (eg video surreptitiously transmitted by a recording device). This is joint work with Daniel J. Dubois, Anna Maria Mandalari, Roman Kolcun, and Hamed Haddadi.</li> 
            <li>In <b>RPKI is Coming of Age: A Longitudinal Study of RPKI Deployment and Invalid Route Origins</b>, led by former NEU postdoc Taejoong Chung, we study the evolution of the RPKI deployment using a unique dataset containing all RPKI Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) from the moment RPKI was first deployed. We find that the RPKI has seen a rapid increase in adoption over the past two years, and recently misconfigurations are rare, meaning that the deployment is ready for prime time and ready for ISPs to drop RPKI invalid routes. This is joint work with Emile Aben, Tim Bruijnzeels, Balakrishnan Chandrasekaran, Dave Levin, Bruce Maggs, Alan Mislove, Roland van Rijswijk-Deij, John P. Rula, and Nick Sullivan.</li>
        </ul>
    <li><span class="label label-success">6/7/19</span> Tenure achievement unlocked! I am beyond excited to report that the President and Board of Trustees of Northeastern University have approved my promotion to Associate Professor with tenure. I have so many people to thank, including all of my outstanding <a href="https://david.choffnes.com/collaborators.php">collaborators</a> and colleagues, and of course my family for supporting me along this long and fruitful journey.
    <li><span class="label label-success">5/3/19</span> Beyond proud to report that my PhD student's work on analyzing global net neutrality violations using <a href="https://dd.meddle.mobi">Wehe</a> was accepted to SIGCOMM 2019! This was a multiyear effort with tons of support from the rest of the research team (Arian Niaki and Phililpa Gill from UMass, and Alan Mislove and me at NEU), along with important contributions to app and system development from Kirill Voloshin, Harsh Modi, I-Farn Chen, and more. I'd also like to think the 100,000+ users who have run tests using our Wehe apps, Arcep for our collaboration on auditing net neutrality violations in France, and our other partners/sponsors (the NSF, Google, Verizon Labs, and Measurement-Lab, and Amazon AWS).</li>
    <li><span class="label label-success">8/3/18</span> I will be co-chairing the program committee for the 20th edition of the Passive and Active Measurement (PAM) Conference, to be held in Chilean Patagonia (Puerto Varas)! More details at the <a href="http://pam2019.niclabs.cl">PAM 2019 website</a>. Looking forward to seeing great measurement submissions.</li>
     <li><span class="label label-success">7/31/18</span> Pleased to report that our work on measuring whether we're ready to move to HTTPS certificate validation via OSCP was accepted to IMC '18. Joint work with Taejoong Chung, Jay Lok, Balakrishnan Chandrasekaran, Dave Levin, Bruce Maggs, Alan Mislove, John Rula, Nick Sullivan (Cloudflare) and Christo Wilson.
    <li><span class="label label-success">7/3/18</span> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/these-academics-spent-the-last-year-testing-whether-you-1826961188">Coverage of our work on apps that spy on you</a>. TL;DR: We didn't see abuse of microphone or cameras, but we did see how apps are recording your every move and sending images/videos of this to third parties. We responsibly disclosed to Google and others, they took action to mitigate this privacy risk. More details in <a href="https://recon.meddle.mobi/panoptispy/">our paper</a>.
    <li><span class="label label-success">5/4/18</span> My recently graduated Ph.D. student, <a href="https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/people/arash-molavi-kakhki/">Dr. Arash Molavi Kakhki</a>, won the 2018 Northeastern CCIS Excellence in Research Award. Congrats, Arash!</li>
    <li><span class="label label-success">5/2/18</span> Just a few end-of-semester updates:
        <ul>
            <li>Our paper "Panoptispy: Characterizing Audio and Video Exfiltration from Android Applications" was accepted to PETs 2018. We found some scary stuff and are in the process of responsible disclosure, so stay tuned.</li>
            <li>Our paper "A First Look at Certification Authority Authorization (CAA)" appeared in <a href="https://ccronline.sigcomm.org/2018/the-april-2018-issue/">SIGCOMM CCR's April issue</a>. This is joint work with TUM, RWTH Aachen, University of Twente, and University of Sydney.</li>
            <li>I'm co-chairing the <a href="https://irtf.org/anrw/2018/">IRTF Applied Networking Research Workshop</a> to be held at IETF 102. We received over 40 submissions in this reboot of the workshop, which promises to feature a great program.</li>
            <li>My PhD student Jingjing Ren <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/audio-video/video/privacy-con-2018-part-2">presented</a> her NDSS work on privacy leaks over time at the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/2018/02/privacycon-2018">FTC's annual PrivacyCon event</a>.</li>
            <li>I testified again at the MA state legislature on the topic of net neutrality.</li>
            <li>We've now received more than a half million tests from our <a href="https://wehe.ccs.neu.edu">Wehe app</a>. Download it now for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wehe/id1309242023?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.meddle.wehe&hl=en_US">Android</a>, learn if your ISP is violating net neutrality.</li>
        </ul>
    <li><span class="label label-success">2/20/18</span> Our paper, <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2018/02/ndss2018_02A-1_Jero_paper.pdf">Automated Attack Discovery in TCP Congestion Control Using a Model-guided Approach</a>, won the <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2018/">Cisco Network Security Best Paper Award at NDSS</a>! Joint work with Samuel Jero, Endadul Hoque, Alan Mislove, and Cristina Nita-Rotaru.

</li>
    <li><span class="label label-success">2/12/18</span> First update of the new year. Just a few things happened...
        <ul>
            <li>Our <a href="https://dd.meddle.mobi">Wehe app</a> for detecting net neutrality violations got quite a bit of attention, in large part due to Apple <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5vn9k/apple-blocking-net-neutrality-app-wehe">rejecting our app</a> and then later reversing its decision. Our work was subsequently covered by dozens of news outlets, and a piece about net neutrality featuring this work appeared on <a href="https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/8xd4dg/are-mobile-carriers-already-violating-net-neutrality">VICE News</a>. Thanks to this publicity we have received over 100,000 tests worldwide, and we will be updating our website with our findings as we process the data. </li>
            <li>I testified to the Massachusetts State Senate Committee on Net Neutrality and Consumer Protection, you can find coverage <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2018/02/06/mass-ag-says-state-net-neutrality-legislation-may.html">here</a>.</li>
            <li>Arash Molavi Kakhki, my recently graduated PhD student, won the IRTF's Applied Networking Research Prize for his <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2017/papers/imc17-final39.pdf">work on QUIC</a> that was published at IMC 2017.</li>
        </ul>
     <li><span class="label label-success">12/24/17</span> Year-end update: 
       <ul>
           <li>Our longitudinal study on app privacy (to appear in NDSS'18) was selected for presentation at FTC PrivacyCon 2018.</li>
           <li>A first look at in-flight WiFi (joint work with Northwestern) was accepted to WWW'18.</li>
           <li>I led a panel on <a href="http://datatransparencylab.org/dtl-conference-2017-review/">tools for data transparency</a> at the DTL'17 conference, featuring Ashkan Soltani, Kashmir Hill, Justin Brookman, Franck Baudot, and Andrea Martens.</li>
           <li>ReCon was awarded a grant from the Comcast Innovation Fund.</li>
           <li><a href="http://dd.meddle.mobi">Wehe</a>, our tool for detecting net neutrality violations, has been selected by ARCEP (the French telecom regulator) for providing consumers in France the ability to monitor and report ISPs that unlawfully differentiate network traffic.</li>
           <li>More exciting news to report in 2018!</li>
         </ul></li>
     <li><span class="label label-success">10/30/17</span> Excited to report that I will have two papers appearing at NDSS 2018! "Bug Fixes, Improvements, ... and Privacy Leaks - A Longitudinal Study of PII Leaks Across Android App Versions" -- joint work with UCSB, U of Helsinki and IMDEA/ICSI -- explores how app privacy leaks change over time. "Automated Attack Discovery in TCP Congestion Control Using a Model-guided Approach" -- joint work with Purdue and FIU -- combines the generality of implementation-agnostic fuzzing with the precision of runtime analysis to find attacks against implementations of TCP congestion control.</li>
    <li><span class="label label-success">9/8/17</span> I gave a talk about DPI middleboxes and their implications for policymakers at <a href="http://www.tprcweb.com/">TPRC 45</a>. Read my paper on the topic <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2941535">here</a>. </li>
    <li><span class="label label-success">8/21/17</span> The <a href="http://www.harvest-documentary.com/">Harvest documentary film</a>, which is based on data gathered from the <a href="https://recon.meddle.mobi">ReCon Project</a>, is now <a href="http://www.harvest-documentary.com/#/film/">available online for free</a>! This short film (11 minutes) appeared at several presitigious film festivals, including Aspen Shortsfest, HotDocs, Seattle International Film Festival, and Rooftop Films summer series. </li>

<h3>Cetera</h3>
<p>Pronouns: He/him.</p>

<p>
	For those who don't know me, the following passage has become a theme
	that runs through my life. In short, I "push the rock," just like <a
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus">Sisyphus</a> from Greek
	mythology. But Camus tells it better:
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 1em; font-style: italic">As for this myth, one
	sees merely the whole effort of a body straining to raise the huge
	stone, to roll it and push it up a slope a hundred times over; one sees
	the face screwed up, the cheek tight against the stone, the shoulder
	bracing the clay-covered mass, the foot wedging it, the fresh start
	with arms outstretched, the wholly human security of two earth-clotted
	hands. At the very end of his long effort measured by skyless space and
	time without depth, the purpose is achieved. Then Sisyphus watches the
	stone rush down in a few moments toward that lower world whence he will
	have to push it up again toward the summit. He goes back down to the
	plain. It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests
	me. A face that toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see
	that man going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the
	torment of which he will never know the end. That hour like a
	breathing-space which returns as surely as his suffering, that is the
	hour of consciousness. At each of those moments when he leaves the
	heights and gradually sinks toward the lairs of the gods, he is
	superior to his fate. He is stronger than his rock.</div>
