<h2 class="first">Postdoctoral Researcher Opportunity</h2>

<br/>
<p>
  <b>Project:</b>  Continuous Reconfiguration of Polymorphic Hardware<br />
  <b>Location:</b> Cornell University, Ithaca, NY<br />
  <b>Advisers:</b> Christopher Batten, Adrian Sampson, Zhiru Zhang<br />
  <b>Duration:</b> 1-2 years starting fall 2018<br />
</p>

<p>
  The Computer Systems Laboratory at Cornell seeks a postdoctoral
  researcher to help launch a new project to design a new kind of
  continuously reconfigurable machine. The project spans computer
  architecture, compilers, and programming languages research.
</p>

<h3>The Team</h3>

<p>
  The postdoc will work with the research groups of Professors
  Christopher Batten, Adrian Sampson, and Zhiru Zhang in the departments
  of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science. The
  postdoc will have opportunities to mentor PhD, masters, and
  undergraduate researchers in these groups. The project also includes
  research groups at the University of Washington.
</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>

<p>
  While one-off ASICs offer leaps in computational efficiency even in
  face of slowed returns from Moore's law, they sacrifice flexibility and
  programmability. We are designing a new kind of reconfigurable
  architecture based on a programmable memory system and configurable
  spatial compute fabric. The system is designed for high-frequency
  reconfiguration based on shifting application demands. It includes an
  HBM2 memory interface and CGRA-like spatial array of RISC-V cores with
  a reconfigurable interconnect. The project aims to approach ASIC-like
  efficiency by continuously optimizing the system's organization to
  specialize the compute datapath and exploit the HBM2 memory's high
  bandwidth and low latency. We plan to tape out prototype hardware and
  build a realistic compiler toolchain to target it.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
  We are seeking recent PhDs in CS or ECE with expertise in architecture
  and/or compilers. Researchers in one area or the other will fit well;
  researchers whose interests span hardware and software are ideal. Prior
  work on FPGAs, CGRAs, spatial architectures, program synthesis, and JIT
  compilers is all relevant. Good candidates will be "builders" and have
  a track record of releasing or deploying real systems.
</p>

<h3>The Job</h3>

<p>
  The position starts in the fall semester of 2018 and lasts for one or
  two years, depending on the candidateâ€™s preference. The postdoc will
  work with the PIs and students to define the research direction, build
  the system, release open-source hardware and software, and write papers
  for top-tier architecture and PL conferences. This is a leadership
  role; there will be opportunities to mentor students and to give talks
  at companies and other universities.
</p>

<h3>Diversity</h3>

<p>
  We take diversity and inclusion seriously. Cornell is a recognized
  employer and educator valuing AA/EEO, Protected Veterans, and
  Individuals with Disabilities.
</p>

<h3>How to Apply</h3>

<p>
<p>
  Send the following materials to Prof. Christopher Batten in PDF format:
  (1) a cover letter summarizing your relevant research experience, why
  you are good fit for the position, and how the position relates to your
  career goals; (2) your CV including a list of all publications; (3) a
  list of 2&ndash;3 references including your PhD research adviser; (4)
  your undergraduate and graduate transcripts. <b>Applications are due by
  August 31st, 2018</b>. Late applications may be considered; please
  reach out to Prof. Batten.
