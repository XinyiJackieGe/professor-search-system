<p> I am interested in <b>intelligent systems</b> that operate in
large, nondeterministic, nonstationary or only partially known domains. Most
of my research centers around techniques for <b>decision making (planning and
learning)</b> that enable single situated <b>agents</b> (such as <b>robots</b>
or <b>decision-support systems</b>) and <b>teams of agents</b> to act
intelligently in their environments and exhibit goal-directed behavior in
real-time, even if they have only incomplete knowledge of their environment,
imperfect abilities to manipulate it, limited or noisy perception or
insufficient reasoning speed. I believe that finding good solutions to these
problems requires approaches that cut across many different fields and,
consequently, my research draws on areas such as <b>artificial
intelligence</b>, decision theory, and operations research. Applications of my
research include planetary exploration, supply-chain management, medicine,
crisis management (such as oil-spill containment), robotics and real-time games
(entertainment, serious games, training and simulation).  </p>
