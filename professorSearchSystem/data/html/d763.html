               <h2>Research Highlights</h2>
               <p>From Twitter hashtags such as #metoo to protests by Mechanical Turk workers in the public sphere, collectives come together online to make progress on shared issues. My research introduces social computing systems that directly center trust and familiarity to more effectively support collective action. Through this work I envision alternate roles for social computing ecosystems in society that directly support efforts for social change.</p>

                    Hive, explores how social systems can help build strong networks by organizing a collective into small teams, then intermixing viewpoints by gradually rotating team membership. I deployed this project with Mozilla to reimagine accessible web browsing with disability advocates online.</p>

                    <p>

                     In this paper, we introduce a new class of collective design system that intermixes people instead of ideas: instead of receiving mere exposure to others' ideas, participants engage deeply with other members of the collective who represent those ideas, increasing engagement and influence. We thus present Hive: a system that  organizes a collective into small teams, then intermixes people by  rotating team membership over time. At a technical level, Hive must balance two competing forces: (1) networks are better at connecting diverse perspectives when network efficiency is high, but (2) moving people diminishes tie strength within teams. Hive balances these two needs through network rotation: an optimization algorithm that computes who should move where, and when. A controlled study compared network rotation to alternative rotation systems which maximize only tie strength or network efficiency, finding that network rotation produced higher-rated proposals. Hive has been deployed by Mozilla for a real-world open design drive to improve Firefox accessibility.

                  <p>Dynamo, shows how structured human labor can help move efforts forward when they stall. I undertook this project in collaboration with worker rights advocates on Amazon Mechanical Turk. </p>

                  <p>Dynamo is a platform to support the Mechanical Turk community in forming publics around issues and then mobilizing. We are researching new approaches, systems, and labor mechanisms for collective action online.</p>
                  <blockquote>"Despite their variety, Turkers have something in common—a lack of power. They operate in a realm largely untouched by legislation, unions, and guilds. As a result, the inexperienced can find themselves earning well below minimum wage, or abused by underhanded employers. But a project out of Stanford University [and UC San Diego] is hoping to grant Turkers agency—and might begin to revolutionize the industry. Dynamo is a platform that gives Turkers a collective voice and, consequently, the chance to drive change." -<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/03/amazon-s-turkers-kick-off-the-first-crowdsourced-labor-guild.html">The Daily Beast</a></blockquote>

                  <p>Plenty of academic research passes through AMT or is about Turkers, but ethics boards (IRBs) who review and approve research protocols often don't know how workers want to be treated. Turkers have collectively authored these guidelines to help educate researchers and let Turkers hold them accountable to a higher standard.<br>

                      <em>All around the world, people are writing letters about themselves to a distant, all-powerful figure who can make their dreams come true. But this year, many of those letters will be addressed to Amazon boss Jeff Bezos rather than Father Christmas.</em> - <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/03/amazon-mechanical-turk-workers-protest-jeff-bezos">The Guardian</a>
                    </blockquote>
                    The goals of this campaign are to publicly state that:
                    <ul>
                     <li>Turkers are human beings, not algorithms, and should be marketed accordingly.</li>

                     <li>Turkers should not be sold as cheap labour, but instead skilled, flexible labour which needs to be respected.</li>

                     <li>Turkers need to have a method of representing themselves to Requesters and the world via Amazon.</li>
