Lawson L.S. Wong is an assistant professor at Northeastern University Khoury College of Computer Sciences. Prior to joining Northeastern in 2018, he was a postdoctoral fellow and senior research associate at Brown University, working with Stefanie Tellex. He completed his Ph.D. in 2016 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, advised by Leslie Pack Kaelbling and Tomás Lozano-Pérez. Previously, he received his B.S. (with Honors) and M.S. in Computer Science at Stanford University, both in 2009.

Lawson's research focuses on learning, representing, and estimating knowledge about the world that an autonomous robot may find useful. His research agenda is to identify and learn intermediate state representations that enable effective robot learning and planning, and therefore enable robot generalization. More broadly, Lawson is interested in, and follows many topics within, the fields of robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
