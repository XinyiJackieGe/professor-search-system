<h2>Research</h2>

<p>My general area of research is in developing numerical methods
specialized for high-performance computers, and applying these
methods to solve large-scale scientific computing problems.  
Specific areas that interest me include
numerical linear algebra (e.g., preconditioning, multilevel methods,
sparse and data-sparse matrix computations), 
as well as parallel methods for quantum chemistry,
molecular dynamics, and Brownian/Stokesian dynamics.
