a functional language (we chose Haskell) into synthesizable RTL (we chose SystemVerilog)
suitable for execution on an FPGA or ASIC that was highly parallel. We ultimately produced
such a compiler, relying on the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) as a front-end and writing
our own back-end that performed a series of lowering transformations to restructure such
constructs as recursion, polymorphism, and frst-order functions, into a form suitable for
hardware, then transform the now-restricted functional IR into a datafow representation that
is then finally transformed into synthesizable SystemVerilog.</td>

                      Compiling Irregular Software to Specialized Hardware
                    </td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">High-level synthesis (HLS) has simplified the design process for energy-efficient hardware accelerators: a designer specifies an accelerator’s behavior in a “high-level” language, and a toolchain synthesizes register-transfer level (RTL) code from this specification. Many HLS systems produce efficient hardware designs for regular algorithms (i.e., those with limited conditionals or regular memory access patterns), but most struggle with irregular algorithms that rely on dynamic, data-dependent memory access patterns (e.g., traversing pointer-based structures like lists, trees, or graphs). HLS tools typically provide imperative, side-effectful languages to the designer, which makes it difficult to correctly specify and optimize complex, memory-bound
applications.

In this dissertation, I present an alternative HLS methodology that leverages properties of functional languages to synthesize hardware for irregular algorithms. The main contribution is an optimizing compiler that translates pure functional programs into modular, parallel dataflow networks in hardware. I give an overview of this compiler, explain how its source and target together enable parallelism in the face of irregularity, and present two specific optimizations that further exploit this parallelism. Taken together, this dissertation verifies my thesis that pure functional programs exhibiting irregular memory access patterns can be compiled into specialized hardware and optimized for parallelism.

This work extends the scope of modern HLS toolchains. By relying on properties of pure functional languages, our compiler can synthesize hardware from programs containing constructs that commercial HLS tools prohibit, e.g., recursive functions and dynamic memory allocation. Hardware designers may thus use our compiler in conjunction with existing HLS systems to accelerate a wider class of algorithms than before.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">This master thesis opens with a description of several text summarization methods based
on machine learning approaches inspired by reinforcement learning. While in many cases
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approaches work well for text summarization, they
tend to suffer from poor generalization. We show that techniques which expose the model
to more opportunities to learn from data tend to generalize better and generate summaries
with less lead bias. In our experiments we show that out of the box these new models do
not perform significantly better than MLE when evaluated using Rouge, however do possess
interesting properties which may be used to assemble more sophisticated and better performing
summarization systems.
The main theme of the thesis is getting machine learning models to generalize better using
ideas from reinforcement learning. We develop a new labeling scheme inspired by Reward
Augmented Maximum Likelihood (RAML) methods developed originally for the machine
translation task, and discuss how difficult it is to develop models which sample from their
own distribution while estimating the gradient e.g. in Minimum Risk Training (MRT) and
Reinforcement Learning Policy Gradient methods. We show that RAML can be seen as a
compromise between direct optimization of the model towards optimal expected reward using
Monte Carlo methods which may fail to converge, and standard MLE methods which fail to
explore the entire space of summaries, overfit during training by capturing prominent position
features and thus perform poorly on unseen data.
To that end we describe and show results of domain transfer experiments, where we train
the model on one dataset and evaluate on another, and position distribution experiments, in
which we show how the distribution of positions of our models differ from the distribution in
MLE. We also show that our models work better on documents which are less lead biased,
while standard MLE models get significantly worse performance on those documents in particular.
Another topic covered in the thesis is Query Focused text summarization, where a search
query is used to produce a summary with the query in mind. The summary needs to be relevant
to the query, rather than solely contain important information from the document. We use
ii
the recently published Squad dataset and adapt it for the Query Focused summarization task.
We also train deep learning Query Focused models for summarization and discuss problems
associated with that approach. Finally we describe a method to reuse an already trained QA
model for the Query Focused text summarization by introducing a reduction of the QA task
into the Query Focused text summarization. The source code in python for all the techniques
and approaches described in this thesis are available at https://github.com/yanvirin/material.</td>

approaches are comprehensive but seldom used due to their complexity 
and inconvenience. We take a new approach to simplify email encryption 
and improve its usability by implementing receiver-controlled 
encryption: newly received messages are transparently downloaded and 
encrypted to a locally-generated key; the original message is then 
replaced. To avoid the problem of users having to move a single private 
key between devices, we implement per-device key pairs: only public 
keys need be synchronized to a single device. Compromising an email account 
or email server only provides access to encrypted emails. We have 
implemented this scheme for both Android and as a standalone daemon; we 
show that it works with both PGP and S/MIME, is compatible with widely used 
email services including Gmail and Yahoo! Mail, has acceptable overhead, 
and that users consider it intuitive and easy to use.</td>

Grasp planning is a subset of this problem which can be solved through complex geometric and physical analysis or computationally expensive data driven analysis. As grasping problems become more difficult, building analytical models becomes challenging. Consequently, we aim to learn a grasping policy through a simulation-based data driven approach. In this paper, we create and execute tests to evaluate simulator’s suitability for manipulating objects in highly constrained settings. We investigate methods for creating forward models of a robot’s dynamics, and apply a Model Free Reinforcement Learning approach with the goal of developing a grasping policy based solely on proprioception.</td>

POS uses a novel priority-based scheduling algorithm that naturally considers partial order information dynamically, and guarantees that each partial order will be explored with significant probability. This probabilistic guarantee of error detection is exponentially better than state-of-the-art sampling approaches. Besides theoretical guarantees, POS is extremely simple and lightweight to implement. Evaluations show that POS is effective in covering the partial-order space of micro-benchmarks and finding concurrency bugs in real-world programs such as Firefox’s JavaScript engine SpiderMonkey.</td>

To manage an IoT device, the user first needs to join it to an existing network. Then, the IoT device has to be authenticated by the user. The authentication process often requires a two-way communication between the new device and a trusted entity, which is typically a hand- held device owned by the user. To ease and standardize this process, we present the Device Enrollment Protocol (DEP) as a solution to the enrollment problem described above. Starting from DEP, we then showcase the design of an IoT device commissioner and its prototype implementation on Android, named Android Commissioner. The application allows the user to authenticate IoT devices and join them to an existing protected network.</td>

This fault tolerance is enticing on implementing a principled SMR system that replicates general programs, especially server programs that demand high availability. Unfortunately, SMR assumes deterministic execution, but most server programs are multithreaded and thus non-deterministic. Moreover, existing SMR systems provide narrow state machine interfaces to suit specific programs, and it can be quite strenuous and error-prone to orchestrate a general program into these interfaces This paper presents CRANE, an SMR system that trans- parently replicates general server programs. CRANE achieves distributed consensus on the socket API, a common interface to almost all server programs. It leverages deterministic multithreading (specifically, our prior system PARROT) to make multithreaded replicas deterministic. It uses a new technique we call time bubbling to efficiently tackle a difficult challenge of non-deterministic network input timing. Evaluation on five widely used server programs (e.g., Apache, ClamAV, and MySQL) shows that CRANE is easy to use, has moderate overhead, and is robust.</td>

Prior approaches toward automated deobfuscation of Android applications have relied on certain structural parts of apps remaining as landmarks, un-touched by obfuscation. For instance, some prior approaches have assumed that the structural relation- ships between identifiers (e.g. that A represents a class, and B represents a field declared directly in A) are not broken by obfuscators; others have assumed that control flow graphs maintain their structure (e.g. that no new basic blocks are added). Both approaches can be easily defeated by a motivated obfuscator. We present a new approach to deobfuscating Android apps that leverages deep learning and topic modeling on machine code, MACNETO. MACNETO makes few assumptions about the kinds of modifications that an obfuscator might perform, and we show that it has high precision when applied to two different state-of-the-art obfuscators: ProGuard and Allatori.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Dynamic reconfiguration systems guided by coarse-grained program phases has found success in improving overall program performance and energy efficiency. These performance/energy savings are limited by the granularity that program phases are detected since phases that occur at a finer granularity goes undetected and reconfiguration opportunities are missed.  In this study, we detect program phases using interval sizes on the order of tens, hundreds, and thousands of program cycles. This is in stark contrast with prior phase detection studies where the interval size is on the order of several thousands to millions of cycles.  The primary goal of this study is to begin to fill a gap in the literature on phase detection by characterizing super fine-grained program phases and demonstrating an application where detection of these relatively short-lived phases can be instrumental. Traditional models for phase detection including basic block vectors and working set signatures are used to detect super fine-grained phases as well as a less traditional model based on microprocessor activity. Finally, we show an analytical case study where super fine-grained phases are applied to voltage and frequency scaling optimizations.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Just like bugs in single-threaded programs can lead to vulnerabilities, bugs in multithreaded programs can also lead to concurrency attacks. Unfortunately, there is little quantitative data on how well existing tools can detect these attacks. This paper presents the first quantitative study on concurrency attacks and their implications on tools. Our study on 10 widely used programs reveals 26 concurrency attacks with broad threats (e.g., OS privilege escalation), and we built scripts to successfully exploit 10 attacks. Our study further reveals that, only extremely small portions of inputs and thread interleavings (or schedules) can trigger these attacks, and existing concurrency bug detectors work poorly because they lack help to identify the vulnerable inputs and schedules. Our key insight is that the reports in existing detectors have implied moderate hints on what inputs and schedules will likely lead to attacks and what will not (e.g., benign bug reports). With this insight, this paper presents a new directed concurrency attack detection approach and its implementation, OWL. It extracts hints from the reports with static analysis, augments existing detectors by pruning out the benign inputs and schedules, and then directs detectors and its own runtime vulnerability verifiers to work on the remaining, likely vulnerable inputs and schedules. Evaluation shows that OWL reduced 94.3% reports caused by benign inputs or schedules and detected 7 known concurrency attacks. OWL also detected 3 previously unknown concurrency attacks, including a use-after-free attack in SSDB confirmed as CVE-2016-1000324, an integer overflow, HTML integrity violation in Apache and three new MySQL data races confirmed with bug ID 84064, 84122, 84241. All OWL source code, exploit scripts, and results are available at https://github.com/ruigulala/ConAnalysis.</td>

In this work, we present a novel-mechanism which allows debugging of production systems on-the-fly. We leverage user-space virtualization technology (OpenVZ/LXC), to launch replicas from running instances of a production application, thereby having two containers: prod uction (which provides the real output), and debug (for debugging). The debug container provides a sandbox environment for debugging without any perturbation to the production environment. Customized network-proxy agents asynchronously replicate and replay network inputs from clients to both the production and debug-container, as well as safely discard all network output from the debug-container. We evaluated this low-overhead record and replay technique on five real-world applications, finding that it was effective at reproducing real bugs. In comparison to existing monitoring solutions which can slow-down production applications, Kensa allows application monitoring at â€œzero-overheadâ€.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Identifying similar code in software systems can assist many software engineering tasks such as program understanding and software refactoring. While most approaches focus on identifying code that looks alike, some techniques aim at detecting code that functions alike. Detecting these functional clones â€” code that functions alike â€” in object oriented languages remains an open question because of the difficulty in exposing and comparing programsâ€™ functionality effectively, in general cases undecidable. We propose a novel technique, In-Vivo Clone Detection, which detects functional clones in arbitrary programs by identifying and mining their inputs and outputs. The key insight is to use existing workloads to execute programs and then measure functional similarities between programs based on their inputs and outputs. Further, to identify inputs and outputs of programs appropriately, we use the techniques of static and dynamic data flow analysis. These enhancements mitigate the problems in object oriented languages with respect to identifying program I/Os as reported by prior work. We implement such techniques in our system, HitoshiIO, which is open source and freely available. Our experimental results show that HitoshiIO detects âˆ¼ 900 and âˆ¼ 2, 000 functional clones by static and dynamic data flow analysis, respectively, across a corpus of 118 projects. In a random sample of the detected clones by the static data flow analysis, HitoshiIO achieves 68+% true positive rate with only 15% false positive rate.</td>

We call this multi-mobile computing. However, the tremendous device, hardware, and software heterogeneity of mobile systems makes this difficult in practice. We present M2, a system for multi-mobile computing across heterogeneous mobile systems that enable new ways of sharing and combining multiple devices. M2 leverages higher-level device abstractions and encoding and decoding hardware in mobile systems to define a client-server device stack that shares devices seamlessly across heterogeneous systems. M2 introduces device transformation, a new technique to mix and match heterogeneous input and output device data including rich media content. Example device transformations for transparently making existing unmodified apps multi-mobile include fused devices, which combine multiple devices into a more capable one, and translated devices, which can substitute use of one type of device for another. We have implemented an M2 prototype on Android that operates across heterogeneous hardware and software, including multiple versions of Android and iOS devices, the latter allowing iOS users to also run Android apps. Our results using unmodified apps from Google Play show that M2 can enable apps to be combined in new ways, and can run device-intensive apps across multiple mobile systems with modest overhead and qualitative performance indistinguishable from using local device hardware.</td>

As a business owner and student, I implement many software principles daily in both my work and personal life. After experiencing the power of Agile methodologies outside the scope of software engineering, I always think about how I can integrate the computer science skills that I am learning at Columbia in my life. For my study, I seek to learn about other software engineering development processes that can be useful in life. I theorize that if a model such as Agile can provide me with useful tools, then a model that the government and most of the world trusts should have paradigms I can learn with as well. The software model I will study is open source software (OSS). My research examines the lateral software standards of (OSS) and closed source software (CSS). For the scope of this paper, I will focus on research primarily on Linux as the OSS model and Agile as the CSS model. OSS has had an extraordinary impact on the software revolution [1], and CSS models have gained such popularity that itâ€™s paradigms extend far beyond the software engineering space. Before delving into research, I thought the methodologies of OSS and CSS would be radically different. My study shall describe the similarities that exist between these two methodologies. In the process of my research, I was able to implement the values and paradigms that define the OSS development model to work more productively in my business. Software engineering core values and models can be used as a tool to improve our lives.</td>

Their hybrid nature introduces new attack vectors but also provides an opportunity to design of new security architectures. In this work, we present YOLO,--- You Only Live Once --- a security architecture that leverages two unique physical properties of a CPS, inertia: the tendency of objects to stay at rest or in motion, and its built-in reliability to intermittent faults to survive CPS attacks. 

At a high level, YOLO aims to use a new diversified variant for every new sensor input to the CPS&#039;.  The delays involved in YOLO, viz., the delays for rebooting and diversification,  are easily absorbed by the CPS because of the inherent inertia and their ability to withstand minor perturbations.  We implement YOLO on an open source Car Engine Control Unit, and with measurements from a real race car engine show that YOLO is imminently practical.</td>

While most approaches focus on identifying code that looks alike, some researchers propose to detect instead code that functions alike, which are known as functional clones. However, previous work has raised the technical challenges to detect these functional clones in object oriented languages such as Java. We propose a novel technique, In-Vivo Clone Detection, a language-agnostic technique that detects functional clones in arbitrary programs by observing and mining inputs and outputs. We implemented this technique targeting programs that run on the JVM, creating HitoshiIO (available freely on GitHub), a tool to detect functional code clones. Our experimental results show that it is powerful in detecting these functional clones, finding 185 methods that are functionally similar across a corpus of 118 projects, even when there are only very few inputs available. In a random sample of the detected clones, HitoshiIO achieves 68+% true positive rate, while the false positive rate is only 15%.</td>

With this novel architecture we can use Cambits to configure various imaging systems. The host computer al-ways knows the current configuration and presents the user with a menu of functionalities that the configuration can perform. We demonstrate a wide range of computational photography methods including HDR, wide angle, panoramic, collage, kaliedoscopic, post-focus, light field and stereo imaging.

Unfortunately, it remains challenging for developers to best leverage them to minimize cost. This paper presents Grandet, a storage system that greatly reduces storage cost for web applications deployed in the cloud. Grandet provides both a key-value interface and a file system interface, supporting a broad spectrum of web applications. Under the hood, it supports multiple heterogeneous stores, and unifies them by placing each data object at the store deemed most economical. We implemented Grandet on Amazon Web Services and evaluated Grandet on a diverse set of four popular open-source web applications. Our results show that Grandet reduces their cost by an average of 42.4%, and it is fast, scalable, and easy to use. The source code of Grandet is at http://columbia.github.io/grandet.</td>

We present the first in-depth study of ARM virtualization performance on ARM server hardware, including measurements of two popular ARM and x86 hypervisors, KVM and Xen. We show how the ARM hardware support for virtualization can support much faster transitions between the VM and the hypervisor, a key hypervisor operation. However, current hypervisor designs, including both KVM (Type 1) and Xen (Type 2), are not able to lever- age this performance benefit in practice for real application workloads. We discuss the reasons why and show that other factors related to hypervisor software design and implementation have a larger role in overall performance than the speed of micro architectural operations. Based on our measurements, we discuss changes to ARMâ€™s hardware virtualization support that can potentially bridge the gap to bring its faster virtual machine exit mechanism to modern Type 2 hypervisors running real applications. These changes have been incorporated into the latest ARM architecture.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are systems featuring a tight combination of, and coordination between, the systemâ€™s computational and physical elements. Cyber-physical systems include systems ranging from critical infrastructure such as a power grid and transportation system to health and biomedical devices. System reliability, i.e., the ability of a system to perform its intended function under a given set of environmental and operational conditions for a given period of time, is a fundamental requirement of cyber-physical systems. An unreliable system often leads to disruption of service, financial cost and even loss of human life. An important and prevalent type of cyber-physical system meets the following criteria: processing large amounts of data; employing software as a system component; running online continuously; having operator-in-the-loop because of human judgment and an accountability requirement for safety critical systems. This thesis aims to improve system reliability for this type of cyber-physical system.

To improve system reliability for this type of cyber-physical system, I present a system evaluation approach entitled automated online evaluation (AOE), which is a data-centric runtime monitoring and reliability evaluation approach that works in parallel with the cyber-physical system to conduct automated evaluation along the workflow of the system continuously using computational intelligence and self-tuning techniques and provide operator-in-the-loop feedback on reliability improvement. For example, abnormal input and output data at or between the multiple stages of the system can be detected and flagged through data quality analysis. As a result, alerts can be sent to the operator-in-the-loop. The operator can then take actions and make changes to the system based on the alerts in order to achieve minimal system downtime and increased system reliability. One technique used by the approach is data quality analysis using computational intelligence, which applies computational intelligence in evaluating data quality in an automated and efficient way in order to make sure the running system perform reliably as expected. Another technique used by the approach is self-tuning which automatically self-manages and self-configures the evaluation system to ensure that it adapts itself based on the changes in the system and feedback from the operator. To implement the proposed approach, I further present a system architecture called autonomic reliability improvement system (ARIS).

This thesis investigates three hypotheses. First, I claim that the automated online evaluation empowered by data quality analysis using computational intelligence can effectively improve system reliability for cyber-physical systems in the domain of interest as indicated above. In order to prove this hypothesis, a prototype system needs to be developed and deployed in various cyber-physical systems while certain reliability metrics are required to measure the system reliability improvement quantitatively. Second, I claim that the self-tuning can effectively self-manage and self-configure the evaluation system based on the changes in the system and feedback from the operator-in-the-loop to improve system reliability. Third, I claim that the approach is effcient. It should not have a large impact on the overall system performance and introduce only minimal extra overhead to the cyberphysical system. Some performance metrics should be used to measure the effciency and added overhead quantitatively.

Additionally, in order to conduct efficient and cost-effective automated online evaluation for data-intensive CPS, which requires large volumes of data and devotes much of its processing time to I/O and data manipulation, this thesis presents COBRA, a cloud-based reliability assurance framework. COBRA provides automated multi-stage runtime reliability evaluation along the CPS workflow using data relocation services, a cloud data store, data quality analysis and process scheduling with self-tuning to achieve scalability, elasticity and efficiency.

Finally, in order to provide a generic way to compare and benchmark system reliability for CPS and to extend the approach described above, this thesis presents FARE, a reliability benchmark framework that employs a CPS reliability model, a set of methods and metrics on evaluation environment selection, failure analysis, and reliability estimation.

The main contributions of this thesis include validation of the above hypotheses and empirical studies of ARIS automated online evaluation system, COBRA cloud-based reliability assurance framework for data-intensive CPS, and FARE framework for benchmarking reliability of cyber-physical systems. This work has advanced the state of the art in the CPS reliability research, expanded the body of knowledge in this field, and provided some useful studies for further research.</td>

In some formulations of the problem, concentration inequalities (such as Hoeffdingâ€™s inequality) are used to estimate the confidence interval for an approximated aggregated value. Samples are usually chosen until the confidence interval is arbitrarily small enough regardless of how the approximated query answers will be used (for example, in interactive visualizations). In this report, we show how to exploit visualization-specific properties to reduce the sampling complexity of a sampling-based approximate query processing algorithm while preserving certain visualization guarantees (the visual property of relative ordering) with a very high probability.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Detecting â€œsimilar codeâ€ is fundamental to many software engineering tasks. Current tools can help detect code with statically similar syntactic features (code clones). Unfortunately, some code fragments that behave alike without similar syntax may be missed. In this paper, we propose the term â€œcode relativesâ€ to refer to code with dynamically similar execution features. Code relatives can be used for such tasks as implementation-agnostic code search and classification of code with similar behavior for human understanding, which code clone detection cannot achieve. To detect code relatives, we present DyCLINK, which constructs an approximate runtime representation of code using a dynamic instruction graph. With our link analysis based subgraph matching algorithm, DyCLINK detects fine-grained code relatives efficiently. In our experiments, DyCLINK analyzed 290+ million prospective subgraph matches. The results show that DyCLINK detects not only code relatives, but also code clones that the state-of-the-art system is unable to identify. In a code classification problem, DyCLINK achieved 96% precision on average compared with the competitorâ€™s 61%.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Dynamic taint tracking is an information flow analysis that can be applied to many areas of testing. Phosphor is the first portable, accurate and performant dynamic taint tracking system for Java. While previous systems for performing general-purpose taint tracking in the JVM required specialized research JVMs, Phosphor works with standard off-the-shelf JVMs (such as Oracle&#039;s HotSpot and OpenJDK&#039;s IcedTea). Phosphor also differs from previous portable JVM taint tracking systems that were not general purpose (e.g. tracked only tags on Strings and no other type), in that it tracks tags on all variables. We have also made several enhancements to Phosphor, allowing it to track taint tags through control flow (in addition to data flow), as well as allowing it to track an arbitrary number of relationships between taint tags (rather than be limited to only 32 tags). In this demonstration, we show how developers writing testing tools can benefit from Phosphor, and explain briefly how to interact with it.</td>

We present M2, a system for multi-mobile computing by enabling remote sharing and combining of devices across multiple mobile systems. M2 leverages higher-level device abstractions and encoding and decoding hardware in mobile systems to define a cross-platform interface for remote device sharing to operate seamlessly across heterogeneous mobile hardware and software. M2 can be used to build new multi-mobile apps as well as make existing unmodified apps multi-mobile aware through the use of fused devices, which transparently combine multiple devices into a more capable one. We have implemented an M2 prototype on Android that operates across heterogeneous hardware and software, including using Android and iOS remote devices, the latter allowing iOS users to also run Android apps. Our results using unmodified apps from Google Play show that M2 can enable even display-intensive 2D and 3D games to use remote devices across multiple mobile systems with modest overhead and qualitative performance indistinguishable from using local device hardware.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Metamorphic testing is an advanced technique to test programs and applications without a test oracle such as machine learning applications. Because these programs have no general oracle to identify their correctness, traditional testing techniques such as unit testing may not be helpful for developers to detect potential bugs. This paper presents a novel system, KABU, which can dynamically infer properties that describe the characteristics of a program before and after transforming its input at the method level. Metamorphic Properties (MPs) are pivotal to detecting potential bugs in programs without test oracles, but most previous work relies solely on human effort do identify them. This paper also proposes a new testing concept, Metamorphic Differential Testing (MDT). By comparing the MPs between different versions of the same application, KABU can detect potential bugs in the program. We have performed a preliminary evaluation of KABU by comparing the MPs detected by humans with the MPs detected by KABU. Our preliminary results are very promising: KABU can find more MPs as human developers, and its differential testing mechanism is effective at detecting function changes in programs.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We present DisCo, a novel display-camera communication system. DisCo enables displays and cameras to communicate with each other, while also displaying and capturing images for human consumption. Messages are transmitted by temporally modulating the display brightness at high frequencies so that they are imperceptible to humans. Messages are received by a rolling shutter camera which converts the temporally modulated incident light into a spatial flicker pattern. In the captured image, the flicker pattern is superimposed on the pattern shown on the display. The flicker and the display pattern are separated by capturing two images with different exposures. The proposed system performs robustly in challenging real-world situations such as occlusion, variable display size, defocus blur, perspective distortion and camera rotation. Unlike several existing visible light communication methods, DisCo works with off-the-shelf image sensors. It is compatible with a variety of sources (including displays, single LEDs), as well as reflective surfaces illuminated with light sources. We have built hardware prototypes that demonstrate DisCoâ€™s performance in several scenarios. Because of its robustness, speed, ease of use and generality, DisCo can be widely deployed in several CHI applications, such as advertising, pairing of displays with cell-phones, tagging objects in stores and museums, and indoor navigation.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Among all classes of parallel programming abstractions, lock-free data structures are considered one of the most scalable and efficient because of their fine-grained style of synchronization. However, they are also challenging for developers and tools to verify because of the huge number of possible interleavings that result from fine-grained synchronizations.

This paper address this fundamental problem between performance and verifiability of lock-free data structures. We present TXIT, a system that greatly reduces the set of possible interleavings by inserting transactions into the implementation of a lock-free data structure. We leverage hardware transactional memory support from Intel Haswell processors to enforce these artificial transactions. Evaluation on six popular lock-free data structures shows that TXIT makes it easy to verify lock-free data structures while incurring acceptable runtime overhead. Further analysis shows that two inefficiencies in Haswell are the largest contributors to this overhead.</td>

We present Metamorphic Runtime Checking, a novel approach that conducts metamorphic testing of both the entire application and individual functions during a programâ€™s execution.

It is built upon the QEMU whole system emulator, and so analyses have access to all code executing in the guest and all data. PANDA adds the ability to record and replay executions, enabling iterative, deep, whole system analyses. Further, the replay log files are compact and shareable, allowing for repeatable experiments. A nine billion instruction boot of FreeBSD, e.g., is represented by only a few hundred MB. Further, PANDA leverages QEMU&#039;s support of thirteen different CPU architectures to make analyses of those diverse instruction sets possible within the LLVM IR. In this way, PANDA can have a single dynamic taint analysis, for example, that precisely supports many CPUs. PANDA analyses are written in a simple plugin architecture which includes a mechanism to share functionality between plugins, increasing analysis code re-use and simplifying complex analysis development. We demonstrate PANDA&#039;s effectiveness via a number of use cases, including enabling an old but legitimate version of Starcraft to run despite a lost CD key, in-depth diagnosis of an Internet Explorer crash, and uncovering the censorship activities and mechanisms of a Chinese IM client.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Testing stateful applications is challenging, as it can be difficult to identify hidden dependencies on program state. These dependencies may manifest between several test cases, or simply within a single test case. When it&#039;s left to developers to document, understand, and respond to these dependencies, a mistake can result in unexpected and invalid test results. Although current testing infrastructure does not currently leverage state dependency information, we argue that it could, and that by doing so testing can be improved. Our results thus far show that by recovering dependencies between test cases and modifying the popular testing framework, JUnit, to utilize this information, we can optimize the testing process, reducing time needed to run tests by 62% on average. Our ongoing work is to apply similar analyses to improve existing state of the art test suite prioritization techniques and state of the art test case generation techniques.

                    <td class="col-md-2">In correlation-based time-of-flight (C-ToF) imaging systems, light sources with temporally varying intensities illuminate the scene. Due to global illumination, the temporally varying radiance received at the sensor is a combination of light received along multiple paths. Recovering scene properties (e.g., scene depths) from the received radiance requires separating these contributions, which is challenging due to the complexity of global illumination and the additional temporal dimension of the radiance.

We propose phasor imaging, a framework for performing fast inverse light transport analysis using C-ToF sensors. Phasor imaging is based on the idea that by representing light transport quantities as phasors and light transport events as phasor transformations, light transport analysis can be simplified in the temporal frequency domain. We study the effect of temporal illumination frequencies on light transport, and show that for a broad range of scenes, global radiance (multi-path interference) vanishes for frequencies higher than a scene-dependent threshold. We use this observation for developing two novel scene recovery techniques. First, we present Micro ToF imaging, a ToF based shape recovery technique that is robust to errors due to global illumination. Second, we present a technique for separating the direct  and global components of radiance. Both techniques require capturing as few as 3-4 images and minimal computations. We demonstrate the validity of the presented techniques via simulations and experiments performed with our hardware prototype.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Cloud computing offers a scalable, low-cost, and resilient platform for critical applications. Securing these applications against attacks targeting unknown vulnerabilities is an unsolved challenge. Network anomaly detection addresses such zero-day attacks by modeling attributes of attack-free application traffic and raising alerts when new traffic deviates from this model. Content anomaly detection (CAD) is a variant of this approach that models the payloads of such traffic instead of higher level attributes. Zero-day attacks then appear as outliers to properly trained CAD sensors. In the past, CAD was unsuited to cloud environments due to the relative overhead of content inspection and the dynamic routing of content paths to geographically diverse sites. We challenge this notion and introduce new methods for efficiently aggregating content models to enable scalable CAD in dynamically-pathed environments such as the cloud. These methods eliminate the need to exchange raw content, drastically reduce network and CPU overhead, and offer varying levels of content privacy. We perform a comparative analysis of our methods using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Bloom Filter-based classifiers for operation in the cloud or other distributed settings such as wireless sensor networks. We find that content model aggregation offers statistically significant improvements over non-aggregate models with minimal overhead, and that distributed and non-distributed CAD have statistically indistinguishable performance. Thus, these methods enable the practical deployment of accurate CAD sensors in a distributed attack detection infrastructure.</td>

one-time pad was related by David Kahn.  Based on the evidence available
in the AT&amp;T patent files and from interviews and correspondence,
he concluded that  Gilbert Vernam came up with the need for randomness, while
Joseph Mauborgne realized the need for a non-repeating key.  Examination
of other documents
suggests a different narrative.
It is most likely that Vernam came up with the need for non-repetition;
Mauborgne, though, apparently contributed materially to the
invention of the
two-tape variant.  Furthermore, there is reason to suspect that
he suggested the need for randomness to Vernam.
However, neither Mauborgne, Herbert Yardley, nor
anyone at AT&amp;T really understood
the security advantages of the true one-time tape.  Col. Parker Hitt
may have; William Friedman definitely did.  Finally, we

                      Exploring Societal Computing based on the Example of Privacy

                    <td class="col-md-2">Data privacy when using online systems like Facebook and Amazon has become an increasingly popular topic in the last few years. This thesis will consist of the following four projects that aim to address the issues of privacy and software engineering.

First, only a little is known about how users and developers perceive privacy and which concrete measures would mitigate their privacy concerns. To investigate privacy requirements, we conducted an online survey with closed and open questions and collected 408 valid responses. Our results show that users often reduce privacy to security, with data sharing and data breaches being their biggest concerns. Users are more concerned about the content of their documents and their personal data such as location than about their interaction data. Unlike users, developers clearly prefer technical measures like data anonymization and think that privacy laws and policies are less effective. We also observed interesting differences between people from different geographies. For example, people from Europe are more concerned about data breaches than people from North America. People from Asia/Pacific and Europe believe that content and metadata are more critical for privacy than people from North America. Our results contribute to developing a user-driven privacy framework that is based on empirical evidence in addition to the legal, technical, and commercial perspectives.

Second, a related challenge to above, is to make privacy more understandable in complex systems that may have a variety of user interface options, which may change often. As social network platforms have evolved, the ability for users to control how and with whom information is being shared introduces challenges concerning the configuration and comprehension of privacy settings. To address these concerns, our crowd sourced approach simplifies the understanding of privacy settings by using data collected from 512 users over a 17 month period to generate visualizations that allow users to compare their personal settings to an arbitrary subset of individuals of their choosing. To validate our approach we conducted an online survey with closed and open questions and collected 59 valid responses after which we conducted follow-up interviews with 10 respondents. Our results showed that 70% of respondents found visualizations using crowd sourced data useful for understanding privacy settings, and 80% preferred a crowd sourced tool for configuring their privacy settings over current privacy controls.

Third, as software evolves over time, this might introduce bugs that breach usersâ€™ privacy. Further, there might be system-wide policy changes that could change usersâ€™ settings to be more or less private than before. We present a novel technique that can be used by end-users for detecting changes in privacy, i.e., regression testing for privacy. Using a social approach for detecting privacy bugs, we present two prototype tools. Our evaluation shows the feasibility and utility of our approach for detecting privacy bugs. We highlight two interesting case studies on the bugs that were discovered using our tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first technique that leverages regression testing for detecting privacy bugs from an end-user perspective.

Fourth, approaches to addressing these privacy concerns typically require substantial extra computational resources, which might be beneficial where privacy is concerned, but may have significant negative impact with respect to Green Computing and sustainability, another major societal concern. Spending more computation time results in spending more energy and other resources that make the software system less sustainable. Ideally, what we would like are techniques for designing software systems that address these privacy concerns but which are also sustainable â€” systems where privacy could be achieved â€œfor free,â€ i.e., without having to spend extra computational effort. We describe how privacy can indeed be achieved for free â€” an accidental and beneficial side effect of doing some existing computation â€” in web applications and online systems that have access to user data. We show the feasibility, sustainability, and utility of our approach and what types of privacy threats it can mitigate.

Finally, we generalize the problem of privacy and its tradeoffs. As Social Computing has increasingly captivated the general public, it has become a popular research area for computer scientists. Social Computing research focuses on online social behavior and using artifacts derived from it for providing recommendations and other useful community knowledge. Unfortunately, some of that behavior and knowledge incur societal costs, particularly with regards to Privacy, which is viewed quite differently by different populations as well as regulated differently in different locales. But clever technical solutions to those challenges may impose additional societal costs, e.g., by consuming substantial resources at odds with Green Computing, another major area of societal concern. We propose a new crosscutting research area, Societal Computing, that focuses on the technical tradeoffs among computational models and application domains that raise significant societal issues. We highlight some of the relevant research topics and open problems that we foresee in Societal Computing. We feel that these topics, and Societal Computing in general, need to gain prominence as they will provide useful avenues of research leading to increasing benefits for society as a whole.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">This paper introduces energy exchanges, a set of abstractions that allow applications to help hardware and operating systems manage power and energy consumption. Using annotations, energy exchanges dictate when, where, and how to trade performance or accuracy for power in ways that only an applicationâ€™s developer can decide. In particular, the abstractions offer audits and budgets which watch and cap the power or energy of some piece of the application. The interface also exposes energy and power usage reports which an application may use to change its behavior. Such information complements existing system-wide energy management by operating systems or hardware, which provide global fairness and protections, but are unaware of the internal dynamics of an application.

Energy exchanges are implemented as a user-level C++ library. The library employs an accounting technique to attribute  shares of system-wide energy consumption (provided by system-wide hardware energy meters available on newer hardware platforms) to individual application threads. With these per-thread meters and careful tracking of an applicationâ€™s activity, the library exposes energy and power usage for program regions of interest via the energy exchange abstractions with negligible runtime or power overhead. We use the library to demonstrate three applications of energy exchanges: (1) the prioritization of a mobile gameâ€™s energy use over third-party advertisements, (2) dynamic adaptations of the framerate of a video tracking benchmark that maximize performance and accuracy within the confines of a given energy allotment, and (3) the triggering of computational sprints and corresponding cooldowns, based on time, system TDP, and power consumption.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Dynamic taint analysis is a well-known information flow analysis problem with many possible applications. Taint tracking allows for analysis of application data flow by assigning labels to inputs, and then propagating those labels through data flow. Taint tracking systems traditionally compromise among performance, precision, accuracy, and portability. Performance can be critical, as these systems are typically intended to be deployed with software, and hence must have low overhead. To be deployed in security-conscious settings, taint tracking must also be accurate and precise.
Dynamic taint tracking must be portable in order to be easily deployed and adopted for real world purposes, without requiring recompilation of the operating system or language interpreter, and without requiring access to application source code.

We present Phosphor, a dynamic taint tracking system for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that simultaneously achieves our goals of performance, accuracy, precision, and portability. Moreover, to our knowledge, it is the first portable general purpose taint tracking system for the JVM. We evaluated Phosphor&#039;s performance on two commonly used JVM languages (Java and Scala), on two versions of two commonly used JVMs (Oracle&#039;s HotSpot and OpenJDK&#039;s IcedTea) and on Android&#039;s Dalvik Virtual Machine, finding its performance to be impressive: as low as 3% (53% on average), using the DaCapo macro benchmark suite. This paper describes the approach that Phosphor uses to achieve portable taint tracking in the JVM.</td>

systems remain identical. Characteristic examples of this trend are Windows on x86 and Android on ARM.
This homogeneity, sometimes referred to as â€œcomputing oligoculture&quot;, provides a fertile ground for malware
in the highly networked world of today.
One way to counter this problem is to diversify systems so that attackers cannot quickly and easily
compromise a large number of machines. For instance, if each system has a different ISA, the attacker
has to invest more time in developing exploits that run on every system manifestation. It is not that each
individual attack gets harder, but the spread of malware slows down. Further, if the diversified ISA is kept
secret from the attacker, the bar for exploitation is raised even higher.
In this paper, we show that system diversification can be realized by enabling diversity at the lowest
hardware/software interface, the ISA, with almost zero performance overhead. We also describe how prac-
tical development and deployment problems of diversified systems can be handled easily in the context of
popular software distrbution models, such as the mobile app store model. We demonstrate our proposal with
an OpenSPARC FPGA prototype</td>

descriptions with diagrams but few analogies. Several popular 

textbooks on this topic introduce concepts such as pipelining and 

caching in the context of simple paper-only architectures. While 

this instructional style allows important concepts to be covered 

within a given class period, students have difficulty bridging the 

gap between what is covered in classes and real-world 

implementations. Discussing concrete implementations and 

complications would, however, take too much time. 

In this paper, we propose a technique of representing 

microarchitecture building blocks with animated metaphors to 

accelerate the process of learning about complex 

microarchitectures. We represent hardware implementations as 

road networks that include specific patterns of traffic flow found 

in microarchitectural behavior. Our experiences indicate an 83% 

improvement to understanding memory system microarchitecture. 

We believe the mental models developed by these students will

serve them in remembering microarchitectural behavior and 

extend to learning new microarchitectures more easily.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Recent advances in hardware security have led to the development of
FANCI (Functional Analysis for Nearly-Unused Circuit Identification), an
analysis tool that identifies stealthy, malicious circuits within hardware designs that can perform malicious backdoor behavior. Evaluations of such tools against benchmarks and academic attacks are not always equivalent to the dynamic attack scenarios that can arise in the real world. For this reason, we apply a red team/blue team approach to stress-test FANCI&#039;s abilities to efficiently detect malicious backdoor circuits within hardware designs.

In the Embedded Systems Challenge (ESC) 2013, teams from research groups
from multiple continents created designs with malicious backdoors hidden
in them as part of a red team effort to circumvent FANCI. Notably, these
backdoors were not placed into a priori known designs. The red
team was allowed to create arbitrary, unspecified designs. Two interesting results came out of this effort. The first was that FANCI was surprisingly resilient to this wide variety of attacks and was not circumvented by any of the stealthy backdoors created by the red teams. The second result is that frequent-action backdoors, which are backdoors that are not made stealthy, were often successful. These results emphasize the importance of combining FANCI with a reasonable degree of validation testing. The blue team efforts also exposed some aspects of the FANCI prototype that make analysis time-consuming in some cases, which motivates further development of the prototype in the future.</td>

These detectors belong to a class of detectors known as signature-based detectors as they catch malware by comparing a program&#039;s execution pattern (signature) to execution patterns of known malware programs.  In this work, we propose a new class of detectors - anomaly-based hardware malware detectors - that do not require signatures for malware detection, and thus can catch a wider range of malware including potentially novel ones. We use unsupervised machine learning to build profiles of normal program execution based on data from performance counters, and use these profiles to detect significant deviations in program behavior that occur as a result of malware exploitation. We show that real-world exploitation of popular programs such as IE and Adobe PDF Reader on a Windows/x86 platform can be detected with nearly perfect certainty. We also examine the limits and challenges in implementing this approach in face of a sophisticated adversary attempting to evade anomaly-based detection. The proposed detector is complementary to previously proposed signature-based detectors and can be used together to improve security.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Smartphones nowadays have the ground-breaking features that were only a figment of oneâ€™s imagination. For the ever-demanding cellphone users, the exhaustive list of features that a smartphone supports just keeps getting more exhaustive with time. These features aid oneâ€™s personal and professional uses as well. Extrapolating into the future the features of a present-day smartphone, the lives of us humans using smartphones are going to be unimaginably agile.

With the above said emphasis on the current and future potential of a smartphone, the ability to virtualize smartphones with all their real-world features into a virtual platform, is a boon for those who want to rigorously experiment and customize the virtualized smartphone hardware without spending an extra penny. Once virtualizable independently on a larger scale, the idea of virtualized smartphones with all the virtualized pieces of hardware takes an interesting turn with the sensors being virtualized in a way thatâ€™s closer to the real-world behavior.

When accessible remotely with the real-time responsiveness, the above mentioned real-world behavior will be a real dealmaker in many real-world systems, namely, the life-saving systems like the ones that instantaneously get alerts about harmful magnetic radiations in the deep mining areas, etc. And these life-saving systems would be installed on a large scale on the desktops or large servers as virtualized smartphones having the added support of virtualized sensors which remotely fetch the real hardware sensor readings from a real smartphone in real-time. Based on these readings the lives working in the affected areas can be alerted and thus saved by the people who are operating the at the desktops or large servers hosting the virtualized smartphones.

In addition, the direct and one of the biggest advantages of such a real hardware sensor driven Sensor Emulation in an emulated Android(-x86) environment is that the Android applications that use sensors can now run on the emulator and act under the
influence of real hardware sensorsâ€™ due to the emulated sensors. The current work of Sensor Emulation is quite unique when compared to the existing and past sensor-related works. The uniqueness comes from the full-fledged sensoremulation in a virtualized smartphone environment as opposed to building some sophisticated physical systems that usually aggregate the sensor readings from the real hardware sensors, might be in a remote manner and in real-time. For example, wireless sensor networks based remote-sensing systems that install real hardware sensors in remote places and have the sensor readings from all those sensors at a centralized server or something similar, for the necessary real-time or offline analysis. In these systems, apart from collecting mere real hardware sensor readings into a centralized entity, nothing more is being achieved unlike in the current work of Sensor Emulation wherein the emulated sensors behave exactly like the remote real hardware sensors. The emulated sensors can be calibrated, speeded up or slowed down(in terms of their sampling frequency), influence the sensor-based application running inside the virtualized smartphone environment exactly as the real hardware sensors of a real phone would do to the sensor-based application running in that real phone. In essence, the current work is more about generalizing the sensors with all its real-world characteristics as far as possible in a virtualized platform than just a
framework to send and receive sensor readings over the network between the real and virtual phones.

Realizing the useful advantages of Sensor Emulation which is about adding virtualized sensors support to emulated environments, the current work emulates a total of ten sensors present in the real smartphone, Samsung Nexus S, an Android device. Virtual phones run Android-x86 while real phones run Android. The real reason behind choosing Android-x86 for virtual phone is that x86-based Android
devices are feature-rich over ARM based ones, for example a full-fledged x86 desktop or a tablet has more features than a relatively small smartphone. Out of the ten, five are real sensors and the rest are virtual or synthetic ones. The real ones are Accelerometer, Magnetometer, Light, Proximity, and Gyroscope whereas the virtual ones are Corrected Gyroscope, Linear Acceleration, Gravity, Orientation, and Rotation Vector. The emulated Android-x86 is of Android release version Jelly Bean 4.3.1 which differs only very slightly in terms of bug fixes from Android Jelly Bean 4.3 running on the real smartphone.

One of the noteworthy aspects of the Sensor Emulation accomplished is being demand-less - exactly the same sensor-based Android applications will be able to use the sensors on the real and virtual phones, with absolutely no difference in terms of their sensor-based behavior.

The emulationâ€™s core idea is the socket-communication between two modules of Hardware Abstraction Layer(HAL) which is driver-agnostic, remotely over a wireless network in real-time. Apart from a Paired real-device scenario from which the real hardware sensor readings are fetched, the Sensor Emulation also is compatible with a Remote Server Scenario wherein the artificially generated sensor readings are fetched from a remote server. Due to the Sensor Emulation having been built on mereend-to-end socket-communication, itâ€™s logical and obvious to see that the real and virtual phones can run different Android(-x86) releases with no real impact on the
Sensor Emulation being accomplished.

Sensor Emulation once completed was evaluated for each of the emulated sensors using applications from Android Market as well as Amazon Appstore. The applications category include both the basic sensor-test applications that show raw sensor readings, as well as the advanced 3D sensor-driven games which are emulator compatible, especially in terms of the graphics. The evaluations proved the current work of Sensor Emulation to be generic, efficient, robust, fast, accurate, and real.

As of this writing i.e., January 2014, the current work of Sensor Emulation is the sole system-level sensor virtualization work that embraces remoteness in real-time for the emulated Android-x86 systems. It is important to note that though the current work is
targeted for Android-x86, the code written for the current work makes no assumptions about underlying platform to be an x86 one. Hence, the work is also logically seen as compatible with ARM based emulated Android environment though not actually tested.</td>

Our analysis is conducted on different mobile devices (iOS and Android) over various wireless networks (Wi-Fi, 3G and LTE) under dynamic network conditions. Our measurements show that the video players frequently discard a large amount of video content although it is successfully delivered to a client.

We first investigate the root cause of this unwanted behavior. Then, we propose a Quality-of-Service (QoS)-aware video streaming architecture in Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks to reduce the waste of network resource and improve user experience. The architecture includes a selective packet discarding mechanism, which can be placed in packet data network gateways (P-GW). In addition, our QoS-aware rules assist video players in selecting an appropriate resolution under a fluctuating channel condition. We monitor network condition and configure QoS parameters to control availability of the maximum bandwidth in real time. In our experimental setup, the proposed platform shows up to 20.58% improvement in saving downlink bandwidth and improves user experience by reducing buffer underflow period to an average of 32 seconds.</td>

We conduct a detailed study of the YouTube Content Delivery Network (CDN) on PCs and mobile devices over Wi-Fi and 3G networks under varying network conditions. We proved that a location-aware video server selection algorithm assigns a video content server
based on the network attachment point of a client. We found out that such distance-based algorithms carry the risk of directing a client to a less optimal content server, although there may exist other better performing video delivery servers. In order to solve this problem, we propose to use dynamic network information such as packet loss rates and Round Trip Time (RTT)between an edge node of an wireless network (e.g., an Internet Service Provider (ISP) router in a Wi-Fi network and a Radio
Network Controller (RNC) node in a 3G network) and video content servers, to find the optimal video content server when a video is requested. Our empirical study shows that the proposed architecture can provide higher TCP performance, leading to better viewing quality compared to location-based video server selection algorithms.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">When belief propagation (BP) converges, it does so to a stationary point of the Bethe free energy $\F$, and is often strikingly accurate. However, it may converge only to a local optimum or may not converge at all. An algorithm was recently introduced for attractive binary pairwise MRFs which is guaranteed to return an $\eps$-approximation to the global minimum of $\F$ in polynomial time provided the maximum degree $\Delta=O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of variables. Here we significantly improve this algorithm and derive several results including a new approach based on analyzing first derivatives of $\F$, which leads to performance that is typically far superior and yields a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for attractive models without any degree restriction. Further, the method applies to general (non-attractive) models, though with no polynomial time guarantee in this case, leading to the important result that approximating $\log$ of the Bethe partition function, $\log Z_B=-\min \F$, for a general model to additive $\epsilon$-accuracy may be reduced to a discrete MAP inference problem.

A lot of studentsâ€™ mental model when they start learning programming is that â€œif it compiles and runs without crashing, it must work fine.â€ Thus exposure to testing, even at a very basic level, can be very beneficial to the students. In the short term, they will do better on their assignments as testing before submission might help them discover bugs in their implementation that they hadnâ€™t realized. In the long term, they will appreciate the importance of testing as part of the software development life cycle.</td>

Users are consuming Internet services from multiple devices that have multiple network interfaces such as Wi-Fi, LTE, Bluetooth, and possibly wired LAN. Such diverse network connectivity can be used to increase both reliability and performance by running applications over multiple links, sequentially for seamless user experience, or in parallel for bandwidth and performance enhancements. The existing networking stack, however, offers almost no support for intelligently exploiting such network, device, and location diversity.

In this work, we survey recently proposed protocols and architectures that enable heterogeneous networking support. Upon evaluation, we abstract common design patterns and propose a unified networking architecture that makes better use of a heterogeneous dynamic environment, both in terms of networks and devices. The architecture enables mobile nodes to make intelligent decisions about how and when to use each or a combination of networks, based on access policies. With this new architecture, we envision a shift from current applications, which support a single network, location, and device at a time to applications that can support multiple networks, multiple locations, and multiple devices.</td>

However, as these platforms have evolved, the ability for users to control how and with whom information is being shared introduces challenges concerning the configuration and comprehension of privacy settings. To address these concerns, our crowd sourced approach simplifies the understanding of privacy settings by using data collected from 512 users over a 17 month period to generate visualizations that allow users to compare their personal settings to an arbitrary subset of individuals of their choosing. To validate our approach we conducted an online survey with closed and open questions and collected 50 valid responses after which we conducted follow-up interviews with 10 respondents. Our results showed that 80% of users found visualizations using crowd sourced data useful for understanding privacy settings, and 70% preferred a crowd sourced tool for configuring their privacy settings over current privacy controls.</td>

become an increasingly popular topic in the
last few years. However, only a little is known about how users and
developers perceive privacy and which concrete measures would mitigate privacy concerns. To investigate privacy requirements,
we conducted an online survey with closed and open questions and
collected 408 valid responses.
Our results show that users often reduce privacy to security, with
data sharing and data breaches being their biggest concerns. Users are more
concerned about the content of their documents and personal data such as location than
their interaction data.
Unlike users, developers clearly prefer technical measures like data
anonymization and think that privacy laws and policies are less effective.
We also observed interesting differences between people from different
geographies. For example, people from Europe are more concerned about
data breaches than people from North America. People from Asia/Pacific
and Europe believe that content and
metadata are more critical for privacy than people from North America.
Our results contribute to developing a user-driven privacy framework
that is based on empirical evidence in addition to the legal,
technical, and commercial perspectives.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Testing large software packages can become very time intensive. To address this problem, researchers have investigated techniques such as Test Suite Minimization. Test Suite Minimization reduces the number of tests in a suite by removing tests that appear redundant, at the risk of a reduction in fault-finding ability since it can be difficult to identify which tests are truly redundant. We take a completely different approach to solving the same problem of long running test suites by instead reducing the time needed to execute each test, an approach that we call Unit Test Virtualization. With Unit Test Virtualization, we reduce the overhead of isolating each unit test with a lightweight virtualization container. We describe the empirical analysis that grounds our approach and provide an implementation of Unit Test Virtualization targeting Java applications. We evaluated our implementation, VMVM, using 20 real-world Java applications and found that it reduces test suite execution time by up to 97% (on average, 62%) when compared to traditional unit test execution. We also compared VMVM to a well known Test Suite Minimization technique, finding the reduction provided by VMVM to be four times greater, while still executing every test with no loss of fault-finding ability.</td>

Metamorphic testing, introduced by Chen et al., has been shown to be a simple yet effective technique in testing these types of applications: test inputs are transformed in such a way that it is possible to predict the expected change to the output, and if the output resulting from this transformation is not as expected, then a fault must exist.

Here, we improve upon previous work by presenting a new technique called Metamorphic Runtime Checking, which automatically conducts metamorphic testing of both the entire application and individual functions during a program&#039;s execution. This new approach improves the scope, scale, and sensitivity of metamorphic testing by allowing for the identification of more properties and execution of more tests, and increasing the likelihood of detecting faults not found by application-level properties. We also present the results of new mutation analysis studies that demonstrate that Metamorphic Runtime Checking can kill an average of 170% more mutants than traditional, application-level metamorphic testing alone, and advances the state of the art in testing applications without oracles.</td>

previously reported our investigation of the fall 2011 offering of the Columbia University course COMS
W4156 Advanced Software Engineering, and here report on the fall 2012 offering and contrast it to
the previous year. Our main findings are: 1) Although the students in the second offering did not do
very well on the newly added individual assignment specifically focused on metamorphic testing,
thereafter they were better able to find metamorphic properties for their team projects than the
students from the previous year who did not have that preliminary homework and, perhaps most
significantly, did not have the solution set for that homework. 2) Students in the second offering did
reasonably well using the relatively novel metamorphic testing technique vs. traditional black box
testing techniques in their projects (such comparison data is not available for the first offering). 3)
Finally, in both semesters, the majority of the student teams were able to apply metamorphic testing to
their team projects after only minimal instruction, which would imply that metamorphic testing is a
viable strategy for student testers.</td>

applications. To achieve acceptable quality of service, these systems
attempt to preserve packet inter-arrival characteristics, such as inter-packet delay. Consequently, a powerful adversary can mount traffic analysis attacks by observing similar traffic patterns at various points of the network, linking together otherwise unrelated network connections. Previous research has shown that having access to
a few Internet exchange points is enough for monitoring a significant percentage of the network paths from Tor nodes to destination servers.
Although the capacity of current networks makes packet-level monitoring at such a scale quite challenging, adversaries could potentially use less accurate but readily available traffic monitoring functionality, such as Cisco&#039;s NetFlow, to mount large-scale traffic analysis attacks.

In this paper, we assess the feasibility and effectiveness of practical
traffic analysis attacks against the Tor network using NetFlow data.
We present an active traffic analysis method based on deliberately
perturbing the characteristics of user traffic at the server side,
and observing a similar perturbation at the client side through
statistical correlation. We evaluate the accuracy of our method using both in-lab testing, as well as data gathered from a public Tor relay serving hundreds of users. Our method revealed the actual sources of anonymous traffic with 100% accuracy for the in-lab tests,
and achieved an overall accuracy of about 81.4% for the real-world experiments, with an average false positive rate of 6.4%.</td>

According to recent reports, mobile video streaming traffic accounted for 52.8% of total mobile data traffic in 2011, and it is forecast to reach 66.4% in 2015. We analyzed the network traffic behaviors of the two most popular HTTP-based video streaming services: YouTube and Netflix. Our research indicates that the network traffic behavior depends on factors such as the type of device, multimedia applications in use and network conditions. Furthermore, we found that a large part of the downloaded
video content can be unaccepted by a video player even though it is successfully delivered to a client. This unwanted behavior often occurs when the video player changes the resolution in a fluctuating network condition and the playout buffer is full while downloading a video. Some of the measurements show that the discarded data may exceed 35% of the total video content.</td>

We present Chameleon, a multi-persona binary compatibility architecture that allows mobile device users to run applications built for different mobile ecosystems together on the same smartphone or tablet. Chameleon enhances the domestic operating system of a device with personas to mimic the application binary interface of a foreign operating system to run unmodified foreign binary applications. To accomplish this without reimplementing the entire foreign operating system from scratch, Chameleon provides four key mechanisms. First, a multi-persona binary interface is used that can load and execute both domestic and foreign applications that use different sets of system calls. Second, compile-time code adaptation makes it simple to reuse existing unmodified foreign kernel code in the domestic kernel. Third, API interposition and passport system calls make it possible to reuse foreign user code together with domestic kernel facilities to support foreign kernel functionality in user space. Fourth, schizophrenic processes allow foreign applications to use domestic libraries to access proprietary software and hardware interfaces on the device. We have built a Chameleon prototype and demonstrate that it imposes only modest performance overhead and can run iOS applications from the Apple App Store together with Android applications from Google Play on a Nexus 7 tablet running the latest version of Android.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">As ARM CPUs become increasingly common in mobile devices and servers, there is a
growing demand for providing the benefits of virtualization for ARMbased
devices. We present our experiences building the Linux ARM hypervisor, KVM/ARM,
the first full system ARM virtualization solution that can run unmodified guest
operating systems on ARM multicore hardware.  KVM/ARM introduces split-mode
virtualization, allowing a hypervisor to split its execution across CPU modes to
take advantage of CPU mode-specific features. This allows KVM/ARM to leverage
Linux kernel services and functionality to simplify hypervisor development and
maintainability while utilizing recent ARM hardware virtualization extensions to
run application workloads in guest operating systems with comparable performance
to native execution. KVM/ARM has been successfully merged into the mainline
Linux 3.9 kernel, ensuring that it will gain wide adoption as the virtualization
platform of choice for ARM. We provide the first measurements on real hardware
of a complete hypervisor using ARM hardware virtualization support. Our results
demonstrate that KVM/ARM has modest virtualization performance and power costs,
and can achieve lower performance and power costs compared to x86-based Linux
virtualization on multicore hardware.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">A cyber-physical system (CPS) is a system featuring a tight combination of, and coordination between, the systemâ€™s computational and physical elements. System reliability is a critical requirement of cyber-physical systems. An unreliable CPS often leads to system malfunctions, service disruptions, financial losses and even human life. Improving CPS reliability requires an objective measurement, estimation and comparison of the CPS system reliability. This paper describes FARE (Failure Analysis and Reliability Estimation), a framework for benchmarking reliability of cyber-physical systems. Some prior researches have proposed reliability benchmark for some specific CPS such as wind power plant and wireless sensor networks. There were also some prior researches on the components of CPS such as software and some specific hardware. But according to the best of our knowledge, there isnâ€™t any reliability benchmark framework for CPS in general. FARE framework provides a CPS reliability model, a set of methods and metrics on the evaluation environment selection, failure analysis and reliability estimation for benchmarking CPS reliability. It not only provides a retrospect evaluation and estimation of the CPS system reliability using the past data, but also provides a mechanism for continuous monitoring and evaluation of CPS reliability for runtime enhancement. The framework is extensible for accommodating new reliability measurement techniques and metrics. It is also generic and applicable to a wide range of CPS applications. For empirical study, we applied the FARE framework on a smart building management system for a large commercial building in New York City. Our experiments showed that FARE is easy to implement, accurate for comparison and can be used for building useful industry benchmarks and standards after accumulating enough data.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We discuss practical details and basic scalability for two recent ideas for hardware encryption for trojan prevention. The broad idea is to encrypt the data used as inputs to hardware circuits to make it more difficult for malicious attackers to exploit hardware trojans. The two methods we discuss are data obfuscation and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Data obfuscation is a technique wherein specific data inputs are encrypted so that they can be operated on within a hardware module without exposing the data itself to the hardware. FHE is a technique recently discovered to be theoretically possible. With FHE, not only the data but also the operations and the entire circuit are encrypted. FHE primarily exists as a theoretical construct currently. It has been shown that it can theoretically be applied to any program or circuit. It has also been applied in a limited respect to some software. Some initial algorithms for hardware applications have been proposed. We find that data obfuscation is efficient enough to be immediately practical, while FHE is not yet in the practical realm. There are also scalability concerns regarding current algorithms for FHE.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">As Social Computing has increasingly captivated the general public, it
has become a popular research area for computer scientists. Social
Computing research focuses on online social behavior and using
artifacts derived from it for providing recommendations and other
useful community knowledge. Unfortunately, some of that behavior and
knowledge incur societal costs, particularly with regards to Privacy,
which is viewed quite differently by different populations as well as
regulated differently in different locales. But clever technical
solutions to those challenges may impose additional societal costs,
e.g., by consuming substantial resources at odds with Green Computing,
another major area of societal concern. We propose a new crosscutting
research area, \emph{Societal Computing}, that focuses on the
technical tradeoffs among computational models and application domains
that raise significant societal issues.  We highlight some of the
relevant research topics and open problems that we foresee in Societal
Computing.
We feel that
these topics, and Societal Computing in general, need to gain prominence
as they will provide useful avenues of research leading to
increasing benefits for society as a whole.
This thesis will consist of the following four projects that aim to address the issues of Societal Computing.

First, privacy in the context of ubiquitous social computing systems has become a
major concern for society at large.
As the number of online social computing systems that collect user data
grows, concerns with privacy are further exacerbated.
Examples of such online systems include social networks, recommender systems, and so on.
Approaches to addressing these privacy concerns typically require
substantial extra computational resources, which might be beneficial where
privacy is concerned, but may have significant negative impact with respect
to Green Computing and sustainability, another major societal concern.
Spending more computation time results in spending more energy and other
resources that make the software system less sustainable.
Ideally, what we would like are techniques for designing software systems
that address these privacy concerns but which are also sustainable --- systems
where privacy could be achieved ``for free,&#039;&#039; \ie without having to spend
extra computational effort.
We describe how privacy can indeed be achieved for free --- an
accidental and beneficial side effect of doing some existing computation --- in web applications and online systems that have access to user data.
We show the feasibility, sustainability, and utility of our approach and what types of privacy threats it can mitigate.

Second, we aim to understand what the expectations and needs to end-users and software developers are, with respect to privacy in social systems.
Some questions that we want to answer are:
Do end-users care about privacy?
What aspects of privacy are the most important to end-users?
Do we need different privacy mechanisms for technical vs. non-technical users?
Should we customize privacy settings and systems based on the geographic location of the users?
We have created a large scale user study using an online questionnaire to gather privacy requirements from a variety of stakeholders.
We also plan to conduct follow-up semi-structured interviews.
This user study will help us answer these questions.

Third, a related challenge to above, is to make privacy more understandable in complex systems that may have a variety of user interface options, which may change often.
Our approach is to use crowdsourcing to find out how other users deal with privacy and what settings are commonly used to give users feedback on aspects like how public/private their settings are, what common settings are typically used by others, where do a certain users&#039; settings differ from a trusted group of friends, etc.
We have a large dataset of privacy settings for over 500 users on Facebook and we plan to create a user study that will use the data to make privacy settings more understandable.

Finally, end-users of such systems find it increasingly hard to understand complex privacy settings.
As software evolves over time, this might introduce bugs that breach users&#039; privacy.
Further, there might be system-wide policy changes that could change users&#039; settings to be more or less private than before.
We present a novel technique that can be used by \emph{end-users} for detecting changes in privacy, \ie regression testing for privacy.
Using a social approach for detecting privacy bugs, we present two prototype tools.
Our evaluation shows the feasibility and utility of our approach for detecting privacy bugs.
We highlight two interesting case studies on the bugs that were discovered using our tools.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first technique that leverages regression testing for detecting privacy bugs from an end-user perspective.</td>

minimizing delays in emergency response.  This paper presents a floor
localization system intended for emergency calls.  We aim to provide
floor-level accuracy with minimum infrastructure support.  Our
approach is to use multiple sensors, all available in today&#039;s
smartphones, to trace a user&#039;s vertical movements inside buildings.

We make three contributions.  First, we present a hybrid architecture
for floor localization with emergency calls in mind.  The architecture
combines beacon-based infrastructure and sensor-based dead reckoning,
striking the right balance between accurately determining a user&#039;s
location and minimizing the required infrastructure.  Second, we
present the elevator module for tracking a user&#039;s movement in an
elevator.  The elevator module addresses three core challenges that
make it difficult to accurately derive displacement from acceleration.
Third, we present the stairway module which determines the number of
floors a user has traveled on foot.  Unlike previous systems that
track users&#039; foot steps, our stairway module uses a novel landing
counting technique.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Alias analysis is perhaps one of the most crucial and widely used analyses, and has attracted tremendous research efforts over the years. Yet, advanced alias analyses are extremely difficult to get right, and the bugs in these analyses are most likely the reason that they have not been adopted to production compilers. This paper presents NEONGOBY, a system for effectively detecting errors in alias analysis implementations, improving their correctness and hopefully widening their adoption. NEONGOBY works by dynamically observing pointer addresses during the execution of a test program and then checking these addresses against an alias analysis for errors. It is explicitly designed to (1) be agnostic to the alias analysis it checks for maximum applicability and ease of use and (2) detect alias analysis errors that manifest on real-world programs and workloads. It reduces false positives and performance overhead using a practical selection of techniques. Evaluation on three popular alias analyses and real-world programs Apache and MySQL shows that NEONGOBY effectively finds 29 alias analysis bugs with only 2 false positives and reasonable overhead. To enable alias analysis builders to start using NEONGOBY today, we have released it open-source at https://github.com/wujingyue/neongoby, along with our error detection results and proposed patches.</td>

Marginal inference, however, even for this restricted class, is in \#P. We prove new formulations of derivatives of the Bethe free energy, provide bounds on the derivatives and bracket the locations of stationary points, introducing a new technique called Bethe bound propagation. Several results apply to pairwise models whether associative or not. Applying these to discretized pseudo-marginals in the associative case we present a polynomial time approximation scheme for global optimization provided the maximum degree is $O(\log n)$, and discuss several extensions.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">A conventional camera has a limited depth of field (DOF), which often results in defocus blur and loss of image detail. The technique of image refocusing allows a user
to interactively change the plane of focus and DOF of an image after it is captured. One way to achieve refocusing is to capture the entire light field. But this requires a significant compromise of spatial resolution. This is because of the dimensionality gap - the captured information (a light field) is 4-D, while the information required for refocusing (a focal stack) is only 3-D. 

In this paper, we present an imaging system that directly captures a focal stack by physically sweeping the focal plane. We first describe how to sweep the focal plane 
so that the aggregate DOF of the focal stack covers the entire desired depth range without gaps or overlaps. Since the focal stack is captured in a duration of time when scene objects can move, we refer
to the captured focal stack as a duration focal stack. We then propose an algorithm for computing a space-time in-focus index map from the focal stack, which represents the time at which each pixel is best focused. The algorithm is designed to enable a seamless refocusing experience, even for textureless regions and at depth discontinuities. 

We have implemented two prototype focal-sweep cameras and captured several duration focal stacks. Results obtained using our method can be viewed at www.focalsweep.com.</td>

The main findings were: (1) most of the students either misunderstood what metamorphic properties are or fell short of identifying all the metamorphic properties in their respective projects, (2) most of the students that were successful in finding all the metamorphic properties in their respective projects had incorporated certain arithmetic rules into their project logic, and (3) most of the properties identified were numerical metamorphic properties. A possible reason for this could be that the two relevant lectures given in class cited examples of metamorphic properties that were based on numerical properties. Based on the findings of the case study, pertinent suggestions were made in order to improve the impact of lectures provided for Metamorphic Testing.</td>

The cutthroat nature of these classes comes from students attempting to get as high a grade as possible, which may or may not correlate with actual learning.
Further, there is very little collaboration allowed in most introductory CS classes.
Most assignments are completed individually since many educators feel that students learn the most, especially in introductory classes, by working alone.
In addition to completing ``normal&#039;&#039; individual assignments, which have many benefits, we wanted to expose students to collaboration early (via, for example, team projects).
In this paper, we describe how we leveraged competition and collaboration in a CS2 to help students learn aspects of computer science better --- in this case, good software design and software testing --- and summarize student feedback.</td>

Our preliminary work has shown that gamification can be used to boost student engagement and learning in basic software testing.
We seek to expand our gamified software engineering approach to motivate other software engineering best practices.
We propose to build a game layer on top of traditional continuous integration technologies to increase student engagement in development, documentation, bug reporting, and test coverage.
This poster describes to our approach and presents some early results showing feasibility.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The emergency communication systems are undergoing a transition from
the PSTN-based legacy system to an IP-based next generation system.
In the next generation system, GPS accurately provides a user&#039;s
location when the user makes an emergency call outdoors using a mobile
phone.  Indoor positioning, however, presents a challenge because GPS
does not generally work indoors.  Moreover, unlike outdoors, vertical
accuracy is critical indoors because an error of few meters will send
emergency responders to a different floor in a building. 

This paper presents an indoor positioning system which focuses on
improving the accuracy of vertical location.  We aim to provide
floor-level accuracy with minimal infrastructure support.  Our
approach is to use multiple sensors available in today&#039;s smartphones
to trace users&#039; vertical movements inside buildings.

We make three contributions.  First, we present the elevator module
for tracking a user&#039;s movement in elevators.  The elevator module
addresses three core challenges that make it difficult to accurately
derive displacement from acceleration.  Second, we present the
stairway module which determines the number of floors a user has
traveled on foot.  Unlike previous systems that track users&#039; foot
steps, our stairway module uses a novel landing counting technique.
Third, we present a hybrid architecture that combines the sensor-based
components with minimal and practical infrastructure.  The
infrastructure provides initial anchor and periodic corrections of a
user&#039;s vertical location indoors.  The architecture strikes the right
balance between the accuracy of location and the feasibility of
deployment for the purpose of emergency communication.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">System reliability is a fundamental requirement of cyber-physical systems. Unreliable systems can lead to disruption of service, financial cost and even loss of human life. Typical cyber-physical systems are designed to process large amounts of data, employ software as a system component, run online continuously and retain an operator-in-the-loop because of human judgment and accountability requirements for safety-critical systems. This paper describes a data-centric runtime monitoring system named ARIS (Autonomic Reliability Improvement System) for improving the reliability of these types of cyber-physical systems. ARIS employs automated online evaluation, working in parallel with the cyber-physical system to continuously conduct automated evaluation at multiple stages in the system workflow and provide real-time feedback for reliability improvement. This approach enables effective evaluation of data from cyber-physical systems. For example, abnormal input and output data can be detected and flagged through data quality analysis. As a result, alerts can be sent to the operator-in-the-loop, who can then take actions and make changes to the system based on these alerts in order to achieve minimal system downtime and higher system reliability. We have implemented ARIS in a large commercial building cyber-physical system in New York City, and our experiment has shown that it is effective and efficient in improving building system reliability.</td>

This trend has brought database performance to the forefront of high throughput, low energy system design. This paper explores targeted deploy- ment of hardware accelerators to improve the throughput and efficiency of database processing. Partitioning, a critical operation when manipulating large data sets, is often the limiting factor in database performance, and represents a significant amount of the overall runtime of database processing workloads.
This paper describes a hardware-software streaming framework and a hardware accelerator for range partitioning, or HARP. The streaming framework offers seamless execution environment for database processing elements such as HARP. HARP offers performance, as well as orders of magnitude gains in power and area efficiency. A detailed analysis of a 32nm physical design shows 9.3 times the throughput of a highly optimized and optimistic software implementation, while consuming just 3.6% of the area and 2.6% of the power of a single Xeon core in the same technology generation.</td>

As software evolves over time, this might introduce bugs that breach users&#039; privacy.
Further, there might be system-wide policy changes that could change users&#039; settings to be more or less private than before.

We present a novel technique that can be used by end-users for detecting changes in privacy, i.e., regression testing for privacy.
Using a social approach for detecting privacy bugs, we present two prototype tools.
Our evaluation shows the feasibility and utility of our approach for detecting privacy bugs.
We highlight two interesting case studies on the bugs that were discovered using our tools.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first technique that leverages regression testing for detecting privacy bugs from an end-user perspective.</td>

We present CHRONICLER, an approach to remote debugging that captures non-deterministic inputs to applications in a lightweight manner, assuring faithful reproduction of client executions. We evaluated CHRONICLER by creating a Java implementation, CHRONICLERJ, and then by using a set of benchmarks mimicking real world applications and workloads, showing its runtime overhead to be under 10% in most cases (worst case 86%), while an existing tool showed overhead over 100% in the same cases (worst case 2,322%).</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Heavy hitters are data items that occur at high frequency
in a data set. Heavy hitters are among the most important
items for an organization to summarize and understand dur-
ing analytical processing. In data sets with sufficient skew,
the number of heavy hitters can be relatively small. We
take advantage of this small footprint to compute aggregate
functions for the heavy hitters in fast cache memory.
We design cache-resident, shared-nothing structures that
hold only the most frequent elements from the table. Our
approach works in three phases. It first samples and picks
heavy hitter candidates. It then builds a hash table and
computes the exact aggregates of these candidates. Finally,
if necessary, a validation step identifies the true heavy hitters
from among the candidates based on the query specification.
We identify trade-offs between the hash table capacity and
performance. Capacity determines how many candidates
can be aggregated. We optimize performance by the use of
perfect hashing and SIMD instructions. SIMD instructions
are utilized in novel ways to minimize cache accesses, be-
yond simple vectorized operations. We use bucketized and
cuckoo hash tables to increase capacity, to adapt to different
datasets and query constraints.
The performance of our method is an order of magnitude
faster than in-memory aggregation over a complete set of
items if those items cannot be cache resident. Even for item
sets that are cache resident, our SIMD techniques enable
significant performance improvements over previous work.</td>

This problem is even worse for older buildings. We present a new approach, ‘predictive building energy optimization’, which uses machine learning (ML) and automated online evaluation of historical and real-time building data to improve efficiency and reliability of building operations without requiring large amounts of additional capital investment. Our ML approach uses a predictive model to generate accurate energy demand forecasts and automated analyses that can guide optimization of building operations. In parallel, an automated online evaluation system monitors efficiency at multiple stages in the system workflow and provides building operators with continuous feedback. We implemented a prototype of this application in a large commercial building in Manhattan. Our predictive machine learning model applies Support Vector Regression (SVR) to the building’s historical energy use and temperature and wet-bulb humidity data from the building’s interior and exterior in order to model performance for each day. This predictive model closely approximates actual energy usage values, with some seasonal and occupant-specific variability, and the dependence of the data on day-of-the-week makes the model easily applicable to different types of buildings with minimal adjustment. In parallel, an automated online evaluator monitors the building’s internal and external conditions, control actions and the results of those actions. Intelligent real-time data quality analysis components quickly detect anomalies and automatically transmit feedback to building management, who can then take necessary preventive or corrective actions. Our experiments show that this evaluator is responsive and effective in further ensuring reliable and energy-efficient operation of building systems.</td>

Defocus causes the loss of image details. To recover scene details from a defocused region, deblurring techniques must be employed. It is well known that the deblurring quality is closely related to the defocus kernel or point-spread-function (PSF), whose shape is largely determined by the aperture pattern of the camera. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework of aperture evaluation for the purpose of defocus deblurring, which takes the effects of image noise, deblurring algorithm, and the structure of natural images into account. By using the derived evaluation criterion, we are able to solve for the optimal coded aperture patterns. Extensive simulations and experiments are then conducted to compare the optimized coded apertures with previously proposed ones.

The proposed framework of aperture evaluation is further extended to evaluate and optimize extended depth of field (EDOF) cameras. EDOF cameras (e.g., focal sweep and wavefront coding camera) are designed to produce PSFs which are less sensitive to depth variation, so that people can deconvolve the whole image using a single PSF without knowing scene depth. Different choices of camera parameters or the PSF to deconvolve with lead to different deblurring qualities. With the derived evaluation criterion, we are able to derive the optimal PSF to deconvolve with in a closed-form and optimize camera parameters for the best deblurring results.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Given recent increases in the size of main memory in modern machines, it is now common to to store large data sets in RAM for faster processing. Multidimensional access methods aim to provide efficient access to large data sets when queries apply predicates to some of the data dimensions. We examine multidimensional access methods in the context of an in-memory column store tuned for on-line analytical processing or scientific data analysis. We propose a multidimensional data structure that contains a novel combination of a grid array and several bitmaps. The base data is clustered in an order matching that of the index structure. The bitmaps contain one bit per block of data, motivating the
term ``blockmap.&#039;&#039; The proposed data structures are compact, typically taking less than one bit of space per row of data. Partition boundaries can be chosen in a way that reflects both the query workload and the data distribution, and boundaries are not required to evenly divide the data if there is a bias in the query distribution. We examine the theoretical performance of the data structure and experimentally measure its performance on three modern CPUs and one GPU processor. We demonstrate that efficient multidimensional access can be achieved with minimal space overhead.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">A number of computational imaging techniques have been introduced to improve image quality by increasing light throughput. These techniques use optical coding to measure a stronger signal level. However, the performance of these techniques is limited by the decoding step, which amplifies noise. While it is well understood that optical coding can increase performance at low light levels, little is known about the quantitative performance advantage of computational imaging in general settings. In this paper, we derive the performance bounds for various computational imaging techniques. We then discuss the implications of these bounds for several real-world scenarios (illumination conditions, scene properties and sensor noise characteristics). Our results show that computational imaging techniques provide a significant performance advantage in a surprisingly small set of real world settings. These results can be readily used by practitioners to design the most suitable imaging systems given the application at hand.</td>

The experiments were conducted empirically on a real system that runs on Amazon EC2. Our analysis shows that most component faults are masked with a simple automatic failover technique. However, we have also identified fundamental problems that cannot be addressed by simple failover techniques; a problem involving DNS cache in resolvers and a problem involving static failover configurations.

in Murphy et al.’s SEKE 2008 paper “Properties of Machine Learning Applications for Use

1. Permutation of the order of the input data
2. Addition of numerical values by a constant
3. Multiplication of numerical values by a constant
4. Reversal of the order of the input data
5. Removal of part of the data
6. Addition of data to the dataset
While focusing on permutative, additive, and multiplicative properties in functions and
applications, I have sought to identify common programming constructs and code
fragments that strongly indicate that these properties will hold, or fail to hold, along an
execution path in which the code is evaluated. I have constructed a syntax for
expressions representing these common constructs and have also mapped a collection
of these expressions to the metamorphic properties they uphold or invalidate. I have
then developed a general framework to evaluate these properties for programs as a
whole.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">One of the primary concerns of users of cloud-based services and applications is the risk of unauthorized access to their private information. For the common setting in which the infrastructure provider and the online service provider are different, end users have to trust their data to both parties, although they interact solely with the service provider. This paper presents CloudFence, a framework that allows users to independently audit the treatment of their private data by third-party online services, through the intervention of the cloud provider that hosts these services.
CloudFence is based on a fine-grained data flow tracking platform exposed by the cloud provider to both developers of cloud-based applications, as well as their users. Besides data auditing for end users, CloudFence allows service providers to confine the use of sensitive data in well-defined domains using data tracking at arbitrary granularity, offering additional protection against inadvertent leaks and unauthorized access. The results of our experimental evaluation with real-world applications, including an e-store platform and a cloud-based backup service, demonstrate that CloudFence requires just a few changes to existing application code, while it can detect and prevent a wide range of security breaches, ranging from data leakage attacks using SQL injection, to personal data disclosure due to missing or erroneously implemented access control checks.</td>

underground feeders fail less than overhead feeders; cables and

weather temperature leads to more power grid failures. We further

                    <td class="col-md-2">Dynamic data flow tracking (DFT) deals with the tagging and tracking of &quot;interesting&quot; data as they propagate during program execution. DFT has been repeatedly implemented by a variety of tools for numerous purposes, including protection from zero-day and cross-site scripting attacks, detection and prevention of information leaks, as well as for the analysis of legitimate and malicious software. We present libdft, a dynamic DFT framework that unlike previous work is at once fast, reusable, and works with commodity software and hardware. libdft provides an API, which can be used to painlessly deliver DFT-enabled tools that can be applied on unmodified binaries, running on common operating systems and hardware, thus facilitating research and rapid prototyping.

We explore different approaches for implementing the low-level aspects of instruction-level data tracking, introduce a more efficient and 64-bit capable shadow memory, and identify (and avoid) the common pitfalls responsible for the excessive performance overhead of previous studies. We evaluate libdft using real applications with large codebases like the Apache and MySQL servers, and the Firefox web browser. We also use a series of benchmarks and utilities to compare libdft with similar systems. Our results indicate that it performs at least as fast, if not faster, than previous solutions, and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to evaluate the performance overhead of a fast dynamic DFT implementation in such depth. Finally, our implementation is freely available as open source software.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Privacy in the context of ubiquitous social computing systems has become a major concern for the society at large.
As the number of online social computing systems that collect user data grows, this privacy threat is further exacerbated.
There has been some work (both, recent and older) on addressing these privacy concerns.
These approaches typically require extra computational resources, which might be beneficial where privacy is concerned, but when dealing with Green Computing and sustainability, this is not a great option.
Spending more computation time results in spending more energy and more resources that make the software system less sustainable.
Ideally, what we would like are techniques for designing software systems that address these privacy concerns but which are also sustainable - systems where privacy could be achieved ``for free,&#039;&#039; i.e., without having to spend extra computational effort.
In this paper, we describe how privacy can be achieved for free - an accidental and beneficial side effect of doing some existing computation - and what types of privacy threats it can mitigate.
More precisely, we describe a ``Privacy for Free&#039;&#039; design pattern and show its feasibility, sustainability, and utility in building complex social computing systems.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">As our society gains a better understanding of how humans have negatively impacted the environment, research related to reducing carbon emissions and overall energy consumption has become increasingly important. One of the simplest ways to reduce energy usage is by making current buildings less wasteful. By improving energy efficiency, this method of lowering our carbon footprint is particularly worthwhile because it reduces energy costs of operating the building, unlike many environmental initiatives that require large monetary investments. In order to improve the efficiency of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system of a Manhattan skyscraper, 345 Park Avenue, a predictive computer model was designed to forecast the amount of energy the building will consume. This model uses Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR), a method that builds a regression based purely on historical data of the building, requiring no knowledge of its size, heating and cooling methods, or any other physical properties. SVMR employs time-delay coordinates as a representation of the past to create the feature vectors for SVM training. This pure dependence on historical data makes the model very easily applicable to different types of buildings with few model adjustments. The SVM regression model was built to predict a week of future energy usage based on past energy, temperature, and dew point temperature data.</td>

when data is outsourced to a third-party storage provider, such as the \emph{cloud}.
Existing access control solutions mainly focus on preserving confidentiality of stored 
data from unauthorized access and the storage provider. 
However, in this setting, access control policies as 
well as users&#039; access patterns also become privacy sensitive information that 
should be protected from the cloud. We propose a two-level access control scheme
that combines coarse-grained access control enforced at the cloud, which allows to get 
acceptable communication overhead and at the same time limits the information that 
the cloud learns from his partial view of the access rules and the access patterns, 
and fine-grained cryptographic access control enforced at the user&#039;s side, which provides the desired expressiveness 
of the access control policies. Our solution handles both \emph{read} and \emph{write} access control.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">System reliability is a fundamental requirement of Cyber-Physical System, i.e., a system featuring
a tight combination of, and coordination between, the systems computational and physical
elements. Cyber-physical system includes systems ranging from the critical infrastructure such as
power grid and transportation system to the health and biomedical devices. An unreliable system
often leads to disruption of service, financial cost and even loss of human life. This thesis aims
to improve system reliability for cyber-physical systems that meet following criteria: processing
large amount of data; employing software as a system component; running online continuously;
having operator-in-the-loop because of human judgment and accountability requirement for safety
critical systems. The reason that I limit the system scope to this type of cyber-physical system is
that this type of cyber-physical systems are important and becoming more prevalent.
To improve system reliability for this type of cyber-physical systems, I propose a system
evaluation approach named automated online evaluation. It works in parallel with the cyber-physical
system to conduct automated evaluation at the multiple stages along the workflow of
the system continuously and provide operator-in-the-loop feedback on reliability improvement.
It is an approach whereby data from cyber-physical system is evaluated. For example, abnormal
input and output data can be detected and flagged through data quality analysis. As a result, alerts
can be sent to the operator-in-the-loop. The operator can then take actions and make changes to
the system based on the alerts in order to achieve minimal system downtime and higher system
reliability. To implement the proposed approach, I further propose a system architecture named
ARIS (Autonomic Reliability Improvement System).
One technique used by the approach is data quality analysis using computational intelligence
that applies computational intelligence in evaluating data quality in some automated and efficient
way to ensure data quality and make sure the running system to perform as expected reliably.
The computational intelligence is enabled by machine learning, data mining, statistical and probabilistic
analysis, and other intelligent techniques. In a cyber-physical system, the data collected
from the system, e.g., software bug reports, system status logs and error reports, are stored in
some databases. In my approach, these data are analyzed via data mining and other intelligent
techniques so that useful information on system reliability including erroneous data and abnormal
system state can be concluded. These reliability related information are directed to operators so
that proper actions can be taken, sometimes proactively based on the predictive results, to ensure
the proper and reliable execution of the system.
Another technique used by the approach is self-tuning that automatically self-manages and
self-configures the evaluation system to ensure it adapts itself based on the changes in the system
and feedback from the operator. The self-tuning adapts the evaluation system to ensure its proper
functioning, which leads to a more robust evaluation system and improved system reliability.
For feasibility study of the proposed approach, I first present NOVA (Neutral Online Visualization-aided
Autonomic) system, a data quality analysis system for improving system reliability for
power grid cyber-physical system. I then present a feasibility study on effectiveness of some
self-tuning techniques, including data classification, redundancy checking and trend detection.
The self-tuning leads to an adaptive evaluation system that works better under system changes
and operator feedback, which will lead to improved system reliability.
The contribution of the work is an automated online evaluation approach that is able to improve
system reliability for cyber-physical systems in the domain of interest as indicated above. It
enables online reliability assurance of the deployed systems that are not possible to perform robust
tests prior to actual deployment.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We introduce the use of describable visual attributes for face images.                                                                   
Describable visual attributes are labels that can be given to an image to describe its appearance. This thesis focuses mostly on images of faces and the attributes used to describe them, although the concepts also apply to other domains.  Examples of face attributes include gender, age, jaw shape, nose size, etc.  The advantages of an attribute-based representation for vision tasks are manifold: they can be composed to create descriptions at various levels of specificity; they are generalizable, as they can be learned once and then applied to recognize new objects or categories without any further training; and they are efficient, possibly requiring exponentially fewer attributes (and training data) than explicitly naming each category. We show how one can create and label large datasets of real-world images to train classifiers which measure the presence, absence, or degree to which an attribute is expressed in images.  These classifiers can then automatically label new images.

We demonstrate the current effectiveness and explore the future potential of using attributes for image search, automatic face replacement in images, and face verification, via both human and computational experiments. To aid other researchers in studying these problems, we introduce two new large face datasets, named FaceTracer and PubFig, with labeled attributes and identities, respectively.

Finally, we also show the effectiveness of visual attributes in a completely different domain: plant species identification. To this end, we have developed and publicly released the Leafsnap system, which has been downloaded by over half a million users. The mobile phone application is a flexible electronic field guide with high-quality images of the tree species in the Northeast US. It also gives users instant access to our automatic recognition system, greatly simplifying the identification process.</td>

However, the Internet connectivity is intermittent because passengers can access the Internet only when a bus or a train is within the networking coverage of an access point at a stop. To efficiently handle this intermittent network for the public transit system, we propose Internet Cache on Wheels (ICOW), a system that provides a low-cost way for bus and train operators to offer access to Internet content. Each bus or train car is equipped with a smart cache that serves popular content to passengers. The cache updates its content based on passenger requests when it is within range of Internet access points placed at bus stops, train stations or depots. We have developed a system architecture and built a prototype of the ICOW system.  Our evaluation and analysis show that ICOW is significantly more efficient than having passengers contact Internet access points individually and ensures continuous availability of content throughout the journey.</td>

Our proposal leverages the power of gaming utilizing our previously described system HALO. Unlike many previous approaches, we aim to present software testing in disguise - so that students do not recognize (at first) that they are being exposed to software testing. We describe how HALO could be integrated into course assignments as well as the benefits that HALO creates.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Modern network security research has demonstrated a clear need for open sharing of traffic datasets between organizations, a need that has so far been superseded by the challenge of removing sensitive content beforehand. Network Data Anonymization (NDA) is emerging as a field dedicated to this problem, with its main direction focusing on removal of identifiable artifacts that might pierce privacy, such as usernames and IP addresses. However, recent research has demonstrated that more subtle statistical artifacts, also present, may yield fingerprints that are just as differentiable as the former. This result highlights certain shortcomings in current anonymization frameworks -- particularly, ignoring the behavioral idiosyncrasies of network protocols, applications, and users. Recent anonymization results have shown that the extent to which utility and privacy can be obtained is mainly a function of the information in the data that one is aware and not aware of. This paper leverages the predictability of network behavior in our favor to augment existing frameworks through a new machine-learning-driven anonymization technique. Our approach uses the substitution of individual identities with group identities where members are divided based on behavioral similarities, essentially providing anonymity-by-crowds in a statistical mix-net. We derive time-series models for network traffic behavior which quantifiably models the discriminative features of network &quot;behavior&quot; and introduce a kernel-based framework for anonymity which fits together naturally with network-data modeling.</td>

In this paper, we first describe a general fault model for con- current programs and some limitations of previously developed sets of first-order concurrency mutation operators. We then present our new mutation testing approach, which em- ploys synchronization-centric second-order mutation operators that are able to generate subtle concurrency bugs not represented by the first-order mutation. These operators are used in addition to the synchronization-centric first-order mutation operators to form a small set of effective concurrency mutation operators for mutant generation. Our empirical study shows that our set of operators is effective in mutant generation with limited cost and demonstrates that this new approach is easy to implement.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Abstract The star discrepancy is a measure of how uniformly distributed a finite
point set is in the d-dimensional unit cube. It is related to high-dimensional numerical
integration of certain function classes as expressed by the Koksma-Hlawka
inequality. A sharp version of this inequality states that the worst-case error of approximating
the integral of functions from the unit ball of some Sobolev space by
an equal-weight cubature is exactly the star discrepancy of the set of sample points.
In many applications, as, e.g., in physics, quantum chemistry or finance, it is essential
to approximate high-dimensional integrals. Thus with regard to the Koksma-
Hlawka inequality the following three questions are very important:
(i) What are good bounds with explicitly given dependence on the dimension d for
the smallest possible discrepancy of any n-point set for moderate n?
(ii) How can we construct point sets efficiently that satisfy such bounds?
(iii) How can we calculate the discrepancy of given point sets efficiently?
We want to discuss these questions and survey and explain some approaches to
tackle them relying on metric entropy, randomization, and derandomization.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Abstract. We present a new algorithm for estimating the star discrepancy of arbitrary point
sets. Similar to the algorithm for discrepancy approximation of Winker and Fang [SIAM J. Numer.
Anal. 34 (1997), 2028{2042] it is based on the optimization algorithm threshold accepting. Our
improvements include, amongst others, a non-uniform sampling strategy which is more suited for
higher-dimensional inputs and additionally takes into account the topological characteristics of given
point sets, and rounding steps which transform axis-parallel boxes, on which the discrepancy is to be
tested, into critical test boxes. These critical test boxes provably yield higher discrepancy values, and
contain the box that exhibits the maximum value of the local discrepancy. We provide comprehensive
experiments to test the new algorithm. Our randomized algorithm computes the exact discrepancy
frequently in all cases where this can be checked (i.e., where the exact discrepancy of the point set
can be computed in feasible time). Most importantly, in higher dimension the new method behaves
clearly better than all previously known methods.</td>

inconveniently forced to carry multiple cellphones to accommodate
work, personal, and geographic mobility needs.  We present Cells, a
virtualization architecture for enabling multiple virtual
smartphones to run simultaneously on the same physical cellphone
device in a securely isolated manner.  Cells introduces a usage model
of having one foreground virtual phone and multiple background
virtual phones.  This model enables a new device namespace mechanism
and novel device proxies that integrate with lightweight operating system virtualization to efficiently and securely multiplex phone hardware devices across multiple virtual phones while providing native hardware device performance to all applications.  Virtual phone features
include fully-accelerated graphics for gaming, complete power
management features, and full telephony functionality with separately 
assignable telephone numbers and caller ID support.  We have
implemented a Cells prototype that supports multiple Android virtual
phones on the same phone hardware.  Our performance results
demonstrate that Cells imposes only modest runtime and memory 
overhead, works seamlessly across multiple hardware devices including
Google Nexus 1 and Nexus S phones and an NVIDIA tablet, and transparently runs all existing Android applications without any modifications.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">While there has been a lot of research towards improving the accuracy of recommender systems, the resulting systems have tended to become increasingly narrow in suggestion variety.
An emerging trend in recommendation systems is to actively seek out diversity in recommendations, where the aim is to provide unexpected, varied, and serendipitous recommendations to the user.
Our main contribution in this paper is a new approach to diversity in recommendations called ``Social Diversity,&#039;&#039; a technique that uses social network information to diversify recommendation results.
Social Diversity utilizes social networks in recommender systems to leverage the diverse underlying preferences of different user communities to introduce diversity into recommendations.
This form of diversification ensures that users in different social networks (who may not collaborate in real life, since they are in a different network) share information, helping to prevent siloization of knowledge and recommendations.
We describe our approach and show its feasibility in providing diverse recommendations for the MovieLens dataset.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Masquerade attacks are characterized by an adversary stealing
a legitimate user&#039;s credentials and using them to impersonate the victim
and perform malicious activities, such as stealing information. Prior work
on masquerade attack detection has focused on proling legitimate user behavior
and detecting abnormal behavior indicative of a masquerade attack.
Like any anomaly-detection based techniques, detecting masquerade attacks
by proling user behavior suers from a signicant number of false positives.
We extend prior work and provide a novel integrated detection approach in
this paper. We combine a user behavior proling technique with a baiting
technique in order to more accurately detect masquerade activity. We show
that using this integrated approach reduces the false positives by 36% when
compared to user behavior proling alone, while achieving almost perfect detection
results.We also show how this combined detection approach serves as
a mechanism for hardening the masquerade attack detector against mimicry
attacks.</td>

faults diagnosis for end-users has increased. However,
existing failure diagnosis techniques fail to assist the endusers
in accessing the applications and services.
We present DYSWIS, an automatic network fault detection
and diagnosis system for end-users. The key idea is
collaboration of end-users; a node requests multiple nodes
to diagnose a network fault in real time to collect diverse information
from different parts of the networks and infer the
cause of failure. DYSWIS leverages DHT network to search
the collaborating nodes with appropriate network properties
required to diagnose a failure. The framework allows dynamic
updating of rules and probes into a running system.
Another key aspect is contribution of expert knowledge (rules
and probes) by application developers, vendors and network
administrators; thereby enabling crowdsourcing of diagnosis
strategy for growing set of applications.
We have implemented the framework and the software
and tested them using our test bed and PlanetLab to show
that several complex commonly occurring failures can be
detected and diagnosed successfully using DYSWIS, while
single-user probe with traditional tools fails to pinpoint the
cause of such failures. We validate that our base modules
and rules are sufficient to detect infrastructural failures causing
majority of application failures.</td>

routers.  We present NetServ, a programmable node architecture aimed
at turning edge routers into distributed service hosting platforms.
This allows ISPs to allocate router resources to content publishers
and application service pro\-vi\-ders motivated to deploy content and
services at the network edge.  This model provides important benefits
over currently available solutions like CDN.  Content and services can
be brought closer to end users by dynamically installing and removing
custom modules as needed throughout the network.

Unlike previous programmable router proposals which focused on
customizing features of a router, NetServ focuses on deploying content
and services.  All our design decisions reflect this change in focus.
We set three main design goals: a wide-area deployment, a multi-user
execution environment, and a clear economic benefit.  We built a
prototype using Linux, NSIS signaling, and the Java OSGi framework.
We also implemented four prototype applications: ActiveCDN provides
publisher-specific content distribution and processing; KeepAlive
Responder and Media Relay reduce the infrastructure needs of telephony
providers; and Overload Control makes it possible to deploy more
flexible algorithms to handle excessive traffic.</td>

provide accurate estimation based on historical data and it does
not make strong a priori assumptions of failure rate pattern (e.g.,

In this paper, we explore approaches for analyzing the stream of Twitter messages to distinguish between messages about real-world events and non-event messages.

                    <td class="col-md-2">Concurrent programming languages are growing in importance with the advent
of multicore systems. Two major concerns in any concurrent program are data
races and deadlocks. Each are potentially subtle bugs that can be caused by nondeterministic
scheduling choices in most concurrent formalisms. Unfortunately,
traditional race and deadlock detection techniques fail on both large programs, and
small programs with complex behaviors.
We believe the solution is model-based design, where the programmer is presented
with a constrained higher-level language that prevents certain unwanted
behavior. We present the SHIM model that guarantees the absence of data races by
eschewing shared memory.
This dissertation provides SHIM based techniques that aid determinism - models
that guarantee determinism, compilers that generate deterministic code and
libraries that provide deterministic constructs. Additionally, we avoid deadlocks,
a consequence of improper synchronization. A SHIM program may deadlock if it
violates a communication protocol. We provide efficient techniques for detecting
and deterministically breaking deadlocks in programs that use the SHIM model.
We evaluate the efficiency of our techniques with a set of benchmarks. We
have also extended our ideas to other languages. The ultimate goal is to provide
deterministic deadlock-free concurrency along with efficiency. Our hope is that
these ideas will be used in the future while designing complex concurrent systems.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Increasingly, people are sharing 
sensitive personal information via online social networks (OSN).
While such networks do permit users to control what they share with whom,
access control policies are notoriously difficult to configure correctly;
this raises the question of whether OSN users&#039; privacy settings match their sharing intentions. 
We present the results of an empirical evaluation that measures privacy attitudes and intentions
and compares these against the privacy settings on Facebook. Our results indicate a serious mismatch: every one of the 65 participants
in our study confirmed that at least one of the identified violations was in fact a sharing violation.
In other words, OSN users&#039; privacy settings are incorrect.
Furthermore, a majority of users cannot or will not fix such errors.
We conclude that the current approach to privacy settings is fundamentally flawed
and cannot be fixed;
a fundamentally different approach is needed. We present recommendations to
ameliorate the current problems, as well as provide suggestions for future
research.</td>

Massively multiplayer online games, in which a large number of players collaborate with each other to achieve common goals in the game, have become extremely pervasive.
By working together towards a common goal, players become more engrossed in the game.
In everyday work environments, this sort of engagement would be beneficial, and is often sought out.
We propose an approach to software engineering called HALO that builds upon the properties found in popular games, by turning work into a game environment.
Our proposed approach can be viewed as a model for a family of prospective games that would support the software development process.
Utilizing operant conditioning and flow theory, we create an immersive software development environment conducive to increased productivity.
We describe the mechanics of HALO and how it could fit into typical software engineering processes.</td>

physiological elements of the human body for purposes of training, prototyping, and decision making. Software can also be used to simulate medical processes and protocols to measure cost effectiveness and resource utilization. Whereas much of the software engineering research into simulation software focuses on validation (determining that the simulation accurately models real-world activity), to date there has been little investigation into the testing of simulation software itself, that is, the ability to effectively search for errors in the implementation. This is particularly challenging because often there is no test oracle to indicate whether the results of the simulation are correct.  In this paper, we present an approach to systematically testing simulation software in the absence of test oracles, and evaluate the effectiveness of the technique.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Modern Voice-over-IP (VoIP) communication systems provide a bundle of services to their users. These services range from the most basic voice-based services such as voice calls and voicemail to more advanced ones such as conferencing, voicemail-to-text, and online address books. Besides voice, modern VoIP systems provide video calls and video conferencing, presence, instant messaging (IM), and even desktop sharing services. These systems also let their users establish a voice, video, or a text session with devices in cellular, public switched telephone network (PSTN), or other VoIP networks.

The peer-to-peer (p2p) paradigm for building VoIP systems involves minimal or no use of managed servers and is therefore attractive from an administrative and economic perspective. However, the benefits of using p2p paradigm in VoIP systems are not without their challenges. First, p2p communication (VoIP) systems can be deployed in environ-
ments with varying requirements of scalability, connectivity, security, interoperability, and performance. These requirements bring forth the question of designing open and standardized protocols for diverse deployments. Second, the presence of restrictive network address
translators (NATs) and firewalls prevents machines from directly exchanging packets and is problematic from the perspective of establishing direct media sessions. The p2p communication systems address this problem by using an intermediate peer with unrestricted
connectivity to relay the session or by preferring the use of TCP. This technique for addressing connectivity problems raises questions about the reliability and session quality of p2p communication systems compared with the traditional client-server VoIP systems. Third,
while administrative overheads are likely to be lower in running p2p communication systems as compared to client-server, can the same be said about the energy efficiency? Fourth, what type of techniques can be used to gain insights into the performance of a deployed
p2p VoIP system like Skype?

The thesis addresses the challenges in designing, building, and analyzing peer-to-peer communication systems. The thesis presents Peer-to-Peer Protocol (P2PP), an open protocol for building p2p communication systems with varying operational requirements. P2PP
is now part of the IETF&#039;s P2PSIP protocol and is on track to become an RFC. The thesis describes the design and implementation of OpenVoIP, a proof-of-concept p2p communication system to demonstrate the feasibility of P2PP and to explore issues in building p2p communication systems. The thesis introduces a simple and novel analytical model for analyzing the reliability of peer-to-peer communication systems and analyzes the feasibility of TCP for sending real-time traffic. The thesis then analyzes the energy efficiency of peer-to-peer and client-server VoIP systems and shows that p2p VoIP systems are less energy efficient than client-server even if the peers consume a small amount of energy for running the p2p network. Finally, the thesis presents an analysis of the Skype protocol which indicates that Skype is free-riding on the network bandwidth of universities.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Anonymous communication networks like Tor
partially protect the confidentiality of their users&#039; traffic by
encrypting all intra-overlay communication.
However, when the relayed traffic
reaches the boundaries of the overlay network towards its actual
destination, the original user traffic is inevitably exposed.  At this
point, unless end-to-end encryption is used, sensitive user data can
be snooped by a malicious or compromised exit node, or by any other
rogue network entity on the path towards the actual destination.

We explore the use of decoy traffic for the detection of traffic
interception on anonymous proxying systems.  Our approach is based on
the injection of traffic that exposes bait credentials for decoy
services that require user authentication.  Our aim is to entice
prospective eavesdroppers to access decoy accounts on servers under
our control using the intercepted credentials.  We have deployed our
prototype implementation in the Tor network using decoy IMAP and SMTP
servers. During the course of six months, our system detected eight
cases of traffic interception that involved eight different Tor exit
nodes.  We provide a detailed analysis of the detected incidents,
discuss potential improvements to our system, and outline how our
approach can be extended for the detection of HTTP session hijacking
attacks.</td>

We propose a tool that uses data-dependence profiling and binary rewriting to parallelize executables without access to source code. Our technique uses Bernsteinï¿½s conditions to identify independent sets of basic blocks that
can be executed in parallel, introducing a level of granularity between fine-grained instruction level and coarse grained task level parallelism. We analyze dynamically generated control and data dependence graphs to find independent sets of basic blocks which can be parallelized.
We then propose to parallelize these candidates using binary rewriting techniques. Our technique aims to demonstrate the parallelism that remains in serial application by exposing concrete opportunities for parallelism.</td>

Other work investigated the use of trap-based mechanisms as a means

Essays in honour of Klaus Roth. W. W. L. Chen, W. T. Gowers, H. Halberstam, W. M. Schmidt, and R. C. Vaughan (Eds.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2009, 359 – 388] to what we want to call weighted geometric L2-discrepancy. This extended notion allows us to consider weights to moderate the importance of different groups of variables, and additionally volume measures different from the Lebesgue measure as well as classes of test sets different from measurable subsets of Euclidean spaces. 

We relate the weighted geometric L2-discrepancy to numerical integration defined over weighted reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and settle in this way an open problem posed by Novak and Wo´zniakowski. 

Furthermore, we prove an upper bound for the numerical integration error for cubature formulas that use admissible sample points. The set of admissible sample points may actually be a subset of the integration domain of measure zero. We illustrate that particularly in infinite dimensional numerical integration it is crucial to distinguish between the whole integration domain and the set of those sample points that actually can be used by algorithms.</td>

We classify these papers according to an extended version of the VoIP Security Alliance (VoIPSA) Threat Taxonomy. Our goal is to provide a roadmap for researchers seeking to understand existing capabilities and to identify gaps in addressing the numerous threats and vulner- abilities present in VoIP systems. We discuss the implications of our findings with respect to vulnerabilities reported in a variety of VoIP products.

We identify two specific problem areas (denial of service, and service abuse) as requiring significant more attention from the research community. We also find that the overwhelming majority of the surveyed work takes a black box view of VoIP systems that avoids examining their internal structure and implementation. Such an approach may miss the mark in terms of addressing the main sources of vulnerabilities, i.e., implementation bugs and misconfigurations. Finally, we argue for further work on understanding cross-protocol and cross-mechanism vulnerabilities (emergent properties), which are the byproduct of a highly complex system-of-systems and an indication of the issues in future large-scale systems.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Masquerade attacks are a common security problem
that is a consequence of identity theft. Masquerade detection may
serve as a means of building more secure and dependable systems
that authenticate legitimate users by their behavior. Prior work
has focused on user command modeling to identify abnormal
behavior indicative of impersonation. This paper extends prior
work by modeling user search behavior to detect deviations indicating
a masquerade attack. We hypothesize that each individual
user knows their own file system well enough to search in a
limited, targeted and unique fashion in order to find information
germane to their current task. Masqueraders, on the other
hand, will likely not know the file system and layout of another
userï¿½s desktop, and would likely search more extensively and
broadly in a manner that is different than the victim user being
impersonated. We devise a taxonomy of Windows applications
and user commands that are used to abstract sequences of
user actions and identify actions linked to search activities. The
experimental results show that modeling search behavior reliably
detects all masqueraders with a very low false positive rate of
1.1%, far better than prior published results. The limited set of
features used for search behavior modeling also results in large
performance gains over the same modeling techniques that use
larger sets of features.</td>

has become a popular research area for computer scientists. Social
Computing research focuses on online social behavior and using
artifacts derived from it for providing recommendations and other
useful community knowledge. Unfortunately, some of that behavior and
knowledge incur societal costs, particularly with regards to Privacy,
which is viewed quite differently by different populations as well as
regulated differently in different locales. But clever technical
solutions to those challenges may impose additional societal costs,
e.g., by consuming substantial resources at odds with Green Computing,
another major area of societal concern. We propose a new crosscutting
research area, \emph{Societal Computing}, that focuses on the
technical tradeoffs among computational models and application domains
that raise significant societal issues.  We highlight some of the
relevant research topics and open problems that we foresee in Societal
Computing.
We feel that
these topics, and Societal Computing in general, need to gain prominence
as they will provide useful avenues of research leading to
increasing benefits for society as a whole.</td>

As these systems become commonplace and the number of users increases, it will become important for these systems to be able to cope with a large and diverse set of users whose recommendation needs may be very different from each other.
In particular, large scale recommender systems will need to ensure that users&#039; requests for recommendations can be answered with low response times and high throughput. 
In this paper, we explore how to use caches and cached data mining to improve the performance of recommender systems by improving throughput and reducing response time for providing recommendations. 
We describe the structure of our cache, which can be viewed as a prefetch cache that prefetches all types of supported recommendations, and how it is used in our recommender system.
We also describe the results of our simulation experiments to measure the efficacy of our cache.</td>

Previously, metamorphic testing has been shown to be a simple yet effective technique in detecting defects, even without an oracle. In metamorphic testing, the application&#039;s ``metamorphic properties&#039;&#039; are used to modify existing test case input to produce new test cases in such a manner that, when given the new input, the new output can easily be computed based on the original output. If the new output is not as expected, then a defect must exist. In practice, however, metamorphic testing can be a manually intensive technique for all but the simplest cases. The transformation of input data can be laborious for large data sets, and errors can occur in comparing the outputs when they are very complex. In this paper, we present a tool called Amsterdam that automates metamorphic testing by allowing the tester to easily set up and conduct metamorphic tests with little manual intervention, merely by specifying the properties to check, configuring the framework, and running the software. Additionally, we describe an approach called Heuristic Metamorphic Testing, which addresses issues related to false positives and non-determinism, and we present the results of new empirical studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of metamorphic testing techniques at detecting defects in real-world programs without test oracles.</td>

LOOM is a “live-workaround” system designed to
quickly and safely bypass application races at runtime.
LOOM provides a flexible and safe language for developers
to write execution filters that explicitly synchronize
code. It then uses an evacuation algorithm to safely install
the filters to live applications to avoid races. It reduces
its performance overhead using hybrid instrumen-
tation that combines static and dynamic instrumentation.

We evaluated LOOM on nine real races from a diverse
set of six applications, including MySQL and Apache.
Our results show that (1) LOOM can safely fix all evaluated
races in a timely manner, thereby increasing application
availability; (2) LOOM incurs little performance
overhead; (3) LOOM scales well with the number of application
threads; and (4) LOOM is easy to use.</td>

Therefore, benchmarks are created to both evaluate and compare the scanners. Unfortunately, most existing benchmarks suffer from various drawbacks, often by testing against inappropriate criteria that does not reflect the user&#039;s needs. To deal with this problem, we present an approach called Baseline that coaches the user in picking the minimal set of weaknesses (i.e., a baseline) that a qualified scanner should be able to detect and also helps the user evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the scanner in detecting those chosen weaknesses. Baseline&#039;s goal is not to serve as a generic ranking system for web vulnerability scanners, but instead to help users choose the most appropriate scanner for their specific needs.</td>

the approximation error for the solution $u$ in the $L_2(I^d)$-sense.  We say
that a problem is tractable if the minimal number of information operations
of $f$ and $q$ needed to obtain an $\varepsilon$-approximation is
sub-exponential in $\varepsilon^{-1}$ and~$d$. One information operation
corresponds to the evaluation of one linear functional or one function
value. The lack of sub-exponential behavior may be defined in various ways,
and so we have various kinds of tractability.  In particular, the problem
is strongly polynomially tractable if the minimal number of information
operations is bounded by a polynomial in $\varepsilon^{-1}$ for all~$d$.

We show that tractability (of any kind whatsoever) for the Fredholm problem
is equivalent to tractability of the $L_2$-approximation problems over the
spaces of right-hand sides and kernel functions.  So (for example) if both
these approximation problems are strongly polynomially tractable, so is the
Fredholm problem.  In general, the upper bound provided by this proof is
essentially non-constructive, since it involves an interpolatory algorithm
that exactly solves the Fredholm problem (albeit for finite-rank
approximations of~$f$ and~$q$).  However, if linear functionals are
permissible and that $F_d$ and~$Q_{2d}$ are tensor product spaces, we are
able to surmount this obstacle; that is, we provide a fully-constructive
algorithm that provides an approximation with nearly-optimal cost, i.e.,
one whose cost is within a factor $\ln\,\varepsilon^{-1}$ of being optimal.</td>

Here, we step back from the goal of achieving maximal privacy
guarantees in an encrypted search scenario to consider efficiency as
a priority. We propose a privacy
framework for search that allows tuning and optimization of the
trade-offs between privacy and efficiency.
As an instantiation of
the privacy framework we introduce a tunable search system based on
the SADS scheme and provide detailed measurements demonstrating the
trade-offs of the constructed system. We also analyze other existing
encrypted search schemes with respect to this framework. We further
propose a protocol that addresses the challenge of document content 
retrieval in a search setting with relaxed privacy requirements.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We study the numerical integration problem for functions with
infinitely many variables. The functions we want to integrate
are from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space which is endowed with 
a weighted norm. 
We study the worst case $\epsilon$-complexity which
is defined as the minimal cost among all algorithms whose worst
case error over the Hilbert space unit ball is at most $\epsilon$.
Here we assume that the
cost of evaluating a function depends polynomially on the number
of active variables.

The infinite-dimensional integration problem is (polynomially) 
tractable if the
$\epsilon$-complexity is bounded by a constant times a power of 
$1/\epsilon$. The smallest such power is called the exponent of 
tractability. 

First we study finite-order weights. We provide improved lower
bounds for the exponent of tractability for general finite-order weights
and improved upper bounds for three newly defined classes
of finite-order weights. 
The constructive upper bounds are obtained by multilevel algorithms
that use for each level quasi-Monte Carlo integration points whose
projections onto specific sets of coordinates exhibit a small 
discrepancy. 

The newly defined finite-intersection weights model the situation where
each group of variables interacts with at most $\rho$ other groups 
of variables, where $\rho$ is some fixed number.  
For these weights we obtain a sharp upper bound. This is the
first class of weights for which the exact exponent of tractability
is known for any possible decay of the weights and for any polynomial
degree of the cost function. For  the other two classes of finite-order
weights our upper bounds are sharp if, e.g., 
the decay of the 
weights
is fast or slow enough.

We extend our analysis to the case of arbitrary weights.
In particular, from our results for finite-order
weights, we conclude a lower bound on the exponent 
of tractability for arbitrary weights and a constructive upper bound for 
product weights. 

Although we confine ourselves for simplicity to 
explicit upper bounds for four classes of 
weights, we stress that our multilevel algorithm together with our
default choice of quasi-Monte Carlo points 
is applicable to any class of weights.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Many software security vulnerabilities only reveal themselves under certain conditions, i.e., particular configurations and inputs together with a certain runtime environment. One approach to detecting these vulnerabilities is fuzz testing that feeds randomly generated inputs to the software and witnesses its failures. However, typical fuzz testing makes no guarantees regarding the syntactic and semantic validity of the input, or of how much of the input space will be explored. To address these problems, we present a new testing methodology called Configuration Fuzzing. Configuration Fuzzing is a technique whereby the configuration of the running application is mutated at certain execution points, in order to check for vulnerabilities that only arise in certain conditions. As the application runs in the deployment environment, this testing technique continuously fuzzes the configuration and checks &quot;security invariants&#039;&#039; that, if violated, indicate a vulnerability. We discuss the approach and introduce a prototype framework called ConFu (CONfiguration FUzzing testing framework) implementation. We also present the results of case studies that demonstrate the approach&#039;s feasibility and evaluate its performance.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Masquerade attacks are a common security problem that is
a consequence of identity theft. Prior work has focused on user command
modeling to identify abnormal behavior indicative of impersonation. This
paper extends prior work by modeling user search behavior to detect
deviations indicating a masquerade attack. We hypothesize that each
individual user knows their own le system well enough to search in a
limited, targeted and unique fashion in order to nd information germane
to their current task. Masqueraders, on the other hand, will likely
not know the le system and layout of another user&#039;s desktop, and would
likely search more extensively and broadly in a manner that is dierent
than the victim user being impersonated. We extend prior research by
devising taxonomies of UNIX commands and Windows applications that
are used to abstract sequences of user commands and actions. The experimental
results show that modeling search behavior reliably detects
all masqueraders with a very low false positive rate of 0.13%, far better
than prior published results. The limited set of features used for search
behavior modeling also results in large performance gains over the same
modeling techniques that use larger sets of features.</td>

                      Metamorphic Testing Techniques to Detect Defects in Applications without Test Oracles

                    <td class="col-md-2">Applications in the fields of scientific computing, simulation, optimization, machine learning, etc. are sometimes said to be &quot;non-testable programs&quot; because there is no reliable test oracle to indicate what the correct output should be for arbitrary input. In some cases, it may be impossible to know the program&#039;s correct output a priori; in other cases, the creation of an oracle may simply be too hard. These applications typically fall into a category of software that Weyuker describes as &quot;Programs which were written in order to determine the answer in the first place. There would be no need to write such programs, if the correct answer were known.&quot; The absence of a test oracle clearly presents a challenge when it comes to detecting subtle errors, faults, defects or anomalies in software in these domains.  

Without a test oracle, it is impossible to know in general what the expected output should be for a given input, but it may be possible to predict how changes to the input should effect changes in the output, and thus identify expected relations among a set of inputs and among the set of their respective outputs. This approach, introduced by Chen et al., is known as &quot;metamorphic testing&quot;. In metamorphic testing, if test case input x produces an output f(x), the function&#039;s so-called &quot;metamorphic properties&quot; can then be used to guide the creation of a transformation function t, which can then be applied to the input to produce t(x); this transformation then allows us to predict the expected output f(t(x)), based on the (already known) value of f(x). If the new output is as expected, it is not necessarily right, but any violation of the property indicates a defect. That is, though it may not be possible to know whether an output is correct, we can at least tell whether an output is incorrect.

This thesis investigates three hypotheses. First, I claim that an automated approach to metamorphic testing will advance the state of the art in detecting defects in programs without test oracles, particularly in the domains of machine learning, simulation, and optimization. To demonstrate this, I describe a tool for test automation, and present the results of new empirical studies comparing the effectiveness of metamorphic testing to that of other techniques for testing applications that do not have an oracle. Second, I suggest that conducting function-level metamorphic testing in the context of a running application will reveal defects not found by metamorphic testing using system-level properties alone, and introduce and evaluate a new testing technique called Metamorphic Runtime Checking. Third, I hypothesize that it is feasible to continue this type of testing in the deployment environment (i.e., after the software is released), with minimal impact on the user, and describe a generalized approach called In Vivo Testing. 

Additionally, this thesis presents guidelines for identifying metamorphic properties, explains how metamorphic testing fits into the software development process, and discusses suggestions for both practitioners and researchers who need to test software without the help of a test oracle.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Robust, efficient, and accurate contact response remains a challenging problem in the simulation of deformable materials. Contact models should robustly handle contact between geometry by preventing interpenetrations. This should be accomplished while respecting natural laws in order to maintain physical correctness. We simultaneously desire to achieve these criteria as efficiently as possible to minimize simulation runtimes. Many methods exist that partially achieve these properties, but none yet fully attain all three. This thesis investigates existing methodologies with respect to these attributes, and proposes a novel algorithm for the simulation of deformable materials that demonstrate them all. This new method is analyzed and optimized, paving the way for future work in this simplified but powerful manner of simulation.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Tractability of multivariate problems has become  nowadays
a popular research subject. Polynomial tractability means that the solution 
of a d-variate problem can be solved to within $\varepsilon$ with 
polynomial cost in $\varepsilon^{-1}$ and d. Unfortunately, many
multivariate problems are not polynomially tractable. 
This holds for all non-trivial unweighted linear tensor product problems.
By an unweighted problem we mean the case when all variables and
groups of variables play the same role. 

It seems natural to ask what is the
``smallest&#039;&#039; non-exponential function $T:[1,\infty)\times
[1,\infty)\to[1,\infty)$ for which we have
T-tractability of unweighted linear tensor product problems. That is, when
the cost of a multivariate problem can be bounded 
by a multiple of a power of $T(\varepsilon^{-1},d)$. 
Under natural assumptions, it turns out that this function is
$T^{qpol}(x,y):=\exp((1+\ln\,x)(1+\ln y))$
for all $x,y\in[1,\infty)$.
The function $T^{qpol}$ goes to infinity faster than any
polynomial although not ``much&#039;&#039; faster, and that is why we refer to 
$T^{qpol}$-tractability as quasi-polynomial tractability.

The main purpose of this paper is to promote quasi-polynomial
tractability especially for the study of unweighted multivariate problems.
We do this for the worst case and randomized settings and for
algorithms using arbitrary linear functionals or only function values. 
We prove relations between quasi-polynomial tractability 
in these two settings and for the two classes of algorithms.</td>

To aid in the accuracy and realism of the simulations, we introduce a low overhead approach, called virtual machine verification, for verifying whether the guest OS is in one of a predefined set of states. We provide empirical evidence to show that BotSwindler can be used to induce malware into performing observable actions and demonstrate how this approach is superior to that used in other tools. We present results from a user study to illustrate the believability of the simulations and show that financial bait information can be used to effectively detect compromises through experimentation with real credential-collecting malware.</td>

One approach to detecting these vulnerabilities is fuzz testing. However, typical fuzz testing makes no guarantees regarding the syntactic and semantic validity of the input, or of how much of the input space will be explored. To address these problems, we present a new testing methodology called Configuration Fuzzing. Configuration Fuzzing is a technique whereby the configuration of the running application is mutated at certain execution points, in order to check for vulnerabilities that only arise in certain conditions. As the application runs in the deployment environment, this testing technique continuously fuzzes the configuration and checks &quot;security invariants&#039;&#039; that, if violated, indicate a vulnerability. We discuss the approach and introduce a prototype framework called ConFu (CONfiguration FUzzing testing framework) for implementation. We also present the results of case studies that demonstrate the approach&#039;s feasibility and evaluate its performance.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Software testing of applications in fields like scientific  omputation, simulation, machine learning, etc. is particularly challenging because many applications in these domains have no reliable &quot;test oracle&quot; to indicate whether the program&#039;s output is correct when given arbitrary input. A common approach to testing such applications has been to use a &quot;pseudo-oracle&quot;, in which multiple independently-developed implementations of an algorithm process an input and the results are compared. Other approaches include the use of
program invariants, formal specification languages, trace and log file analysis, and metamorphic testing.

In this paper, we present the results of two empirical studies in which we compare the effectiveness of some of these approaches, including metamorphic testing, pseudo-oracles, and runtime assertion checking. We also analyze the results in terms of the software development process, and discuss suggestions for practitioners and researchers who need to test software without a test oracle.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">For large, complex software systems, it is typically impossible in terms of time and cost to reliably test the application in all possible execution states and configurations before releasing it into production. One proposed way of addressing this problem has been to continue testing and analysis of the application in the field, after it has been deployed. The theory behind this &quot;perpetual testing&quot; approach is that over time, defects will reveal themselves given that multiple instances of the same application may be run globally with different configurations, in different environments, under different patterns of usage, and in different system states.

A practical limitation of many automated approaches to deployment environment testing and analysis is the potentially high performance overhead incurred by the necessary instrumentation. However, it may be possible to reduce this overhead by selecting test cases and performing analysis only in previously-unseen application states, thus reducing the number of redundant tests and analyses that are run. Solutions for fault detection, model checking, security testing, and fault localization in deployed software may all benefit from a technique that ignores application states that have already been tested or explored.

In this paper, we apply such a technique to a testing methodology called &quot;In Vivo Testing&quot;, which conducts tests in deployed applications, and present a solution that ensures that tests are only executed in states that the application has not previously encountered. In addition to discussing our implementation, we present the results of an empirical study that demonstrates its effectiveness, and explain how the new approach can be generalized to assist other automated testing and analysis techniques.</td>

However, it is difficult to test such applications because often there is no &quot;test oracle&quot; to indicate what the correct output should be for arbitrary input. To help address the quality of scientific computing software, in this paper we present a technique for testing the implementations of machine learning classification algorithms on which such scientific computing software depends. Our technique is based on an approach called &quot;metamorphic testing&quot;, which has been shown to be effective in such cases. Also presented is a case study on a real-world machine learning application framework, and a discussion of how programmers implementing machine learning algorithms can avoid the common pitfalls discovered in our study. We also conduct mutation analysis and cross-validation, which reveal that our method has very high effectiveness in killing mutants, and that observing expected cross-validation result alone is not sufficient to test for the correctness of a supervised classification program. Metamorphic testing is strongly recommended as a complementary approach. Finally we discuss how our findings can be used in other areas of computational science and engineering.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Opportunistic networks, which are wireless network &quot;islands&quot; formed when transient and highly mobile nodes meet for a short period of time, are becoming commonplace as wireless devices become more and more popular. It is thus imperative to develop communication tools and applications that work well in opportunistic networks. In particular, group chat and instant messaging applications are particularly lacking for such opportunistic networks today.

In this paper, we present ONEChat, a group chat and instant messaging program that works in such opportunistic networks. ONEChat uses message multicasting on top of service discovery protocols in order to support group chat and reduce bandwidth consumption in opportunistic networks. ONEChat does not require any pre-configuration, a fixed network infrastructure or a client-server architecture in order to operate. In addition, it supports features such as group chat, private rooms, line-by-line or character-by-character messaging, file transfer, etc.

We also present our quantitative analysis of ONEChat, which we believe indicates that the ONEChat architecture is an efficient group collaboration platform for opportunistic networks.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We present a throughput-driven partitioning and a
throughput-preserving merging algorithm for the high-level physical
synthesis of latency-insensitive (LI) systems.  These two algorithms
are integrated along with a published floorplanner in a
new iterative physical synthesis flow to optimize system throughput
and reduce area occupation.  The synthesis flow iterates a
floorplanning-partitioning-floorplanning-merging sequence of
operations to improve the system topology and the physical locations
of cores.  The partitioning algorithm performs bottom-up clustering of
the internal logic of a given IP core to divide it into smaller ones,
each of which has no combinational path from input to output and thus
is legal for LI-interface encapsulation.  Applying this algorithm to
cores on critical feedback loops optimizes their length and in turn
enables throughput optimization via the subsequent floorplanning.
The merging algorithm reduces the number of cores on non-critical
loops, lowering the overall area taken by LI interfaces without
hurting the system throughput.  Experimental results on a large
system-on-chip design show a 16.7% speedup in system throughput and
a 2.1% reduction in area occupation.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Many software security vulnerabilities only reveal themselves under certain conditions, i.e., particular configurations of the software and certain inputs together with its particular runtime environment. One approach to detecting these vulnerabilities is fuzz testing, which feeds a range of randomly modified inputs to a software application while monitoring it for failures. However, typical fuzz testing makes no guarantees regarding the syntactic and semantic validity of the input, or of how much of the input space will be explored. To address these problems, in this proposal we present a new testing methodology called Configuration Fuzzing. Configuration Fuzzing is a technique whereby the configuration of the running application is mutated at certain execution points, in order to check for vulnerabilities that only arise in certain conditions. As the application runs in the deployment environment, this testing technique continuously fuzzes the configuration and checks &quot;security invariants&quot; that, if violated, indicate a vulnerability; however, the fuzzing is performed in a duplicated copy of the original process, so that it does not affect the state of the running application. Configuration Fuzzing uses a covering array algorithm when fuzzing the configuration which guarantees a certain degree of coverage of the configuration space in the lifetime of the program-under-test. In addition, Configuration Fuzzing tests that are run after the software is released ensure representative real-world user inputs to test with. In addition to discussing the approach and describing a prototype framework for implementation, we also present the results of case studies to prove the approach&#039;s feasibility and evaluate its performance.

In this thesis, we will continue developing the framework called ConFu (CONfiguration FUzzi ng framework) that supports the generation of test functions, parallel sandboxed execution and vulnerability detection. Given the initial ConFu, we will optimize the way that configurations get mutated, define more security invariants and conduct additional empirical studies of ConFu&#039;s effectiveness in detecting vulnerabilities.

At the conclusion of this work, we want to prove that ConFu is efficient and effective in detecting common vulnerabilities and tests executed by ConFu can ensure reasonable degree of coverage of both the configuration and user input space in the lifetime of the software.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Software bugs that occur in production are often difficult to reproduce in the lab due to subtle differences in the application
 environment and nondeterminism. Toward addressing this problem, we present Transplay, a system that captures application software bugs as they occur in production and deterministically reproduces them in a completely different environment, potentially running a different operating system, where the application, its binaries and other support data do not exist. Transplay introduces partial checkpointing, a new mechanism that provides two key properties. It efficiently captures the minimal state necessary to reexecute just the last few moments of the application before it encountered a failure. The recorded state, which typically consists of a few megabytes of data, is used to replay the application without requiring the specific application binaries or the original execution environment. Transplay integrates with existing debuggers to provide facilities such as breakpoints and single-stepping to allow the user to examine the contents of variables and other program state at each source line of the application’s replayed execution. We have implemented a Transplay prototype that can record unmodified Linux applications and replay them on different versions of Linux as well as Windows. Experiments with server applications such as the Apache web server show that Transplay can be used in production with modest recording overhead.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">SIP server overload management has attracted interest recently as SIP becomes the core signaling protocol for Next Generation Networks. Yet virtually all existing SIP overload control work is focused on SIP-over-UDP, despite the fact that TCP is increasingly seen as the more viable choice of SIP transport. This paper answers the following questions: is the existing TCP flow control capable of handling the SIP overload problem? If not, why and how can we make it work? We provide a comprehensive explanation of the default SIP-over-TCP overload behavior through server instrumentation. We also propose and implement novel but
simple overload control algorithms without any kernel or protocol level modification. Experimental evaluation shows that with our mechanism the overload performance improves from its original zero throughput to nearly full capacity. Our work also leads to the important high level insight that the traditional notion of TCP flow control alone is incapable of managing overload for time-critical session based applications, which would be applicable not only to SIP, but also to
a wide range of other common applications such as database servers.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We present a signaling architecture for network traffic authorization, Permission-Based Sending (PBS). This architecture aims to prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and other forms of unauthorized traffic. Towards this goal, PBS takes a hybrid approach: a proactive approach of explicit permissions and a reactive approach of monitoring and countering attacks. On-path signaling is used to configure the permission state stored in routers for a data flow. The signaling approach enables easy installation and management of the permission state, and its use of soft-state improves robustness of the system. For secure permission state setup, PBS provides security for signaling in two ways: signaling messages are encrypted end-to-end using public key encryption and TLS provides hop-by-hop encryption of signaling paths.
In addition, PBS uses IPsec for data packet authentication. Our analysis and performance evaluation show that PBS is an effective and scalable solution for preventing various kinds of attack scenarios, including Byzantine attacks.</td>

produce thousands of matches. In addition to filtering, users also specify ranking in their profile, and matches are returned in the form
of a ranked list. Top results in ranked lists are typically homogeneous, which hinders data exploration. For example, a user
looking for 1- or 2-bedroom apartments sorted by price will see a
large number of cheap 1-bedrooms in undesirable neighborhoods before
seeing any apartment with different characteristics. An alternative to
ranking is to group matches on common attribute values (e.g., cheap
1-bedrooms in good neighborhoods, 2-bedrooms with 2 baths). However,
not all groups will be of interest to the user given the ranking
criteria.

We argue here that neither single-list ranking nor attribute-based
grouping is adequate for effective exploration of ranked datasets. We
formalize rank-aware clustering and develop a novel rank-aware
bottom-up subspace clustering algorithm. We evaluate the performance
of our algorithm over large datasets from a leading online dating
site, and present an experimental evaluation of its effectiveness.</td>

Metamorphic testing has been shown to be a simple yet effective technique in addressing the quality assurance of these &quot;non-testable programs&quot;. In metamorphic testing, if test input x produces output f(x), specified &quot;metamorphic properties&quot; are used to create a transformation function t, which can be applied to the input to produce t(x); this transformation then allows the output f(t(x)) to be predicted based on the already-known value of f(x). If the output is not as expected, then a defect must exist.

Previously we investigated the effectiveness of testing based on metamorphic properties of the entire application. Here, we improve upon that work by presenting a new technique called Metamorphic Runtime Checking, a testing approach that automatically conducts metamorphic testing of individual functions during the program&#039;s execution. We also describe an implementation framework called Columbus, and discuss the results of empirical studies that demonstrate that checking the metamorphic properties of individual functions increases the effectiveness of the approach in detecting defects, with minimal performance impact.</td>

Many online algorithms use the example&#039;s margin to decide whether the model should be updated. Usually, the algorithm&#039;s model is updated when the margin is smaller than a certain threshold. The evaluation of the margin for each example requires the algorithm to evaluate all the model&#039;s features. Sequential Analysis allows us to early stop the computation of the margin when uninformative examples are encountered. It is desirable to save computation on uninformative examples since they will have very little impact on the final model.

                    <td class="col-md-2">Hard real-time systems use worst-case execution
time (WCET) estimates to ensure that timing requirements
are met. The typical approach for obtaining WCET estimates
is to employ static program analysis methods. While these
approaches provide WCET bounds, they struggle to analyze
programs with loops whose iteration counts depend on input data.
Such programs mandate user-guided annotations. We propose a
hybrid approach by augmenting static program analysis with
model-checking to analyze such programs and derive the loop
bounds automatically. In addition, we use model-checking to
guarantee repeatable timing behaviors from segments of program
code. Our target platform is a precision timed architecture: a
SPARC-based architecture promising predictable and repeatable
timing behaviors. We use CBMC and illustrate our approach
on Euclidean greatest common divisor algorithm (for WCET
analysis) and a VGA controller (for repeatable timing validation).</td>

In this paper, we expand on this area of study by demonstrating never before seen concepts in advanced shellcode polymorphism with a proof-of-concept engine which we call Hydra. Hydra distinguishes itself by integrating an array of obfuscation techniques, such as recursive NOP sleds and multi-layer ciphering into one system while offering multiple improvements upon existing strategies. We also introduce never before seen attack methods such as byte-splicing statistical mimicry, safe-returns with forking shellcode and syscall-time-locking. In total, Hydra simultaneously attacks signature, statistical, disassembly, behavioral and emulation-based sensors, as well as frustrates of&amp;#64258;ine forensics. This engine was developed to present an updated view of the frontier of modern polymorphic shellcode and provide an effective tool for evaluation of IDS systems, Cyber test ranges and other related security technologies.</td>

This thesis makes significant progress towards understanding both the
possibilities and the limitations of learning various classes of monotone functions by carefully considering the complexity measures used to evaluate them.

We show that Boolean functions computed by polynomial-size monotone circuits are hard to learn assuming the existence of one-way functions. Having shown the hardness of learning general polynomial-size monotone circuits, we show that the class of Boolean functions computed by polynomial-size depth-3 monotone circuits are hard to learn using statistical queries. As a counterpoint, we give a statistical query learning algorithm that can learn random polynomial-size depth-2 monotone circuits (i.e., monotone DNF formulas).

As a preliminary step towards a fully polynomial-time, proper learning algorithm for learning polynomial-size monotone decision trees, we also show the relationship between the average depth of a monotone decision tree, its average sensitivity, and its variance.

Finally, we return to monotone DNF formulas, and we show that they are teachable (a different model of learning) in the average case. We also show that non-monotone DNF formulas, juntas, and sparse GF2 formulas are teachable in the average case.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Desktop computers are often compromised by the interaction of untrusted data and buggy software. To address this problem, we present Apiary, a system that provides transparent application fault containment while retaining the ease of use of a traditional integrated desktop environment. Apiary accomplishes this with three key mechanisms. It isolates applications in containers that integrate in a controlled manner at the display and file system. It introduces ephemeral containers that are quickly instantiated for single application execution and then removed, to prevent any exploit that occurs from persisting and to protect user privacy. It introduces the virtual layered file system to make instantiating containers fast and space efficient, and to make managing many containers no more complex than having a single traditional desktop. We have implemented Apiary on Linux without any application or operating system kernel changes. Our results from running real applications, known exploits, and a 24-person user study show that Apiary has modest performance overhead, is effective in limiting the damage from real vulnerabilities to enable quick recovery, and is as easy to use as a traditional desktop while improving desktop computer security and privacy.</td>

Doing route selection based in part on source addresses is a form of policy routing, which has started to receive increased amounts of attention.  In this paper, we extend the original ROFL (ROuting as the Firewall Layer) scheme by including source prefix constraints in route announcement.  We present algorithms for route propagation and packet forwarding, and demonstrate the correctness of these algorithms using rigorous proofs.  The new scheme not only accomplishes the complete set of filtering functionality provided by traditional firewalls, but also introduces a new direction for policy routing.</td>

conjunction with the ranking to further improve the user&#039;s interaction

states, the checking system can preserve and replay the live
states in which the software failures occur. We introduce
a novel software checking framework that enables application
states including program behaviors and execution
contexts to be cloned and resumed on a computing cloud.
It employs (1) EXPLODE’s model checking engine for a
lightweight and general purpose software checking (2) ZAP
system for faster, low overhead and transparent checkpoint
and resume mechanism through virtualized PODs (PrOcess
Domains), which is a collection of host-independent processes,
and (3) scalable and distributed checking infrastructure

We demonstrate through analytical analysis, simulations, and experiments on planetlab that our architecture can provide high streaming quality for niche content. In particular, we show that our architecture increases the catalog size by up to $40\%$ compared to standard P2P VoD systems, and that a weighted cache policy can reduce the startup delay for niche content by a factor of more than three.</td>

We propose flexible filters as a technique that combines static mapping of the stream program tasks with dynamic load balancing of their execution. The goal is to improve the system-level processing throughput of the program when it is executed on a distributed-memory multi-core system as well as the local (core-level) memory utilization. Our technique is distributed and scalable because it is based on point-to-point handshake signals exchanged between neighboring cores. Load balancing with flexible filters can be applied to stream applications that present large dynamic variations in the computational load of their tasks and the dimension of the stream data tokens. In order to demonstrate the practicality of our technique, we present the performance improvements for the case study of a JPEG encoder running
on the IBM Cell multi-core processor.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The deployment and use of Anomaly Detection (AD) sensors often requires the intervention of a human expert to manually calibrate and optimize their performance. Depending on the site and the type of traffic it receives, the operators might have to provide recent and sanitized training data sets, the characteristics of expected traffic (i.e. outlier ratio), and exceptions or even expected future modifications of system’s behavior. In this paper, we study the potential performance issues that stem from fully automating the AD sensors’ day-to-day maintenance and calibration. Our goal is to remove the dependence on human operator using an unlabeled, and thus potentially dirty, sample of incoming traffic. To that end, we propose to enhance the training phase of AD sensors with a self-calibration phase, leading to the automatic determination of the optimal AD parameters. We show how this novel calibration phase can be employed in conjunction with previously proposed methods for training data sanitization resulting in a fully automated AD maintenance cycle. Our approach is completely agnostic to the underlying AD sensor algorithm. Furthermore, the self-calibration can be applied in an online fashion to ensure that the resulting AD models reflect changes in the system’s behavior which would otherwise render the sensor’s internal state inconsistent. We verify the validity of our approach through a series of experiments where we compare the manually obtained optimal parameters with the ones computed from the self-calibration phase. Modeling traffic from two different sources, the fully automated calibration shows a 7.08% reduction in detection
rate and a 0.06% increase in false positives, in the worst case, when compared to the optimal selection of parameters. Finally, our adaptive models outperform the statically generated ones retaining the gains in performance from the sanitization process over time.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Masquerade attacks are unfortunately a familiar security problem that is a consequence of
identity theft. Detecting masqueraders is very hard. Prior work has focused on user command
modeling to identify abnormal behavior indicative of impersonation. This paper extends prior
work by presenting one-class Hellinger distance-based and one-class SVM modeling techniques
that use a set of novel features to reveal user intent. The specic objective is to model user
search proles and detect deviations indicating a masquerade attack. We hypothesize that
each individual user knows their own le system well enough to search in a limited, targeted
and unique fashion in order to nd information germane to their current task. Masqueraders,
on the other hand, will likely not know the le system and layout of another user&#039;s desktop,
and would likely search more extensively and broadly in a manner that is dierent than the
victim user being impersonated. We extend prior research that uses UNIX command sequences
issued by users as the audit source by relying upon an abstraction of commands. We devise
taxonomies of UNIX commands and Windows applications that are used to abstract sequences
of user commands and actions. We also gathered our own normal and masquerader data sets
captured in a Windows environment for evaluation. The datasets are publicly available for
other researchers who wish to study masquerade attack rather than author identication as in
much of the prior reported work. The experimental results show that modeling search behavior
reliably detects all masqueraders with a very low false positive rate of 0.1%, far better than prior
published results. The limited set of features used for search behavior modeling also results in
huge performance gains over the same modeling techniques that use larger sets of features.</td>

Monitoring systems are also vulnerable to attack. A stealthy attacker can simply turn off or disable these monitoring systems without being detected; he would thus be able to perpetrate the very attacks that these systems were designed to stop. For example, many examples of virus attacks against antivirus scanners have appeared in the wild. In this paper, we present a novel technique to “monitor the monitors” in such a way that (a) unauthorized shutdowns of critical monitors are detected with high probability, (b) authorized shutdowns raise no alarm, and (c) the proper shutdown sequence for authorized shutdowns cannot be inferred from reading memory.  The techniques proposed to prevent unauthorized shut down (turning off) of monitoring systems was inspired by the duality of safety technology devised to prevent unauthorized discharge (turning on) of nuclear weapons.</td>

the vulnerabilities in modern document processing applications. Detecting malcode embedded in a document is difficult owing to the complexity of modern document formats that provide ample opportunity to embed code in a myriad of ways. We focus on Microsoft Word documents as malcode carriers as a case study in this paper. To detect stealthy embedded malcode in documents, we develop an arbitrary data transformation technique that changes the value of data segments in documents in such a way as to purposely damage any hidden malcode that may be embedded in those sections. Consequently, the embedded malcode will not only fail but also introduce a system exception that would be easily detected. The method is intended to be applied in a safe sandbox, the transformation is reversible after testing a document, and does not require any learning phase. The method depends upon knowledge of the structure of the document binary format to parse a document and identify the specific sectors to which the method can be safely applied for malcode detection. The method can be implemented in MS Word as a security feature to enhance the safety of Word documents.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">This report studies the performance impact of using TLS as a transport protocol for SIP servers. We evaluate the cost of TLS
experimentally using a testbed with OpenSIPS, OpenSSL, and Linux running on an Intel-based server. We analyze TLS costs
using application, library, and kernel profiling, and use the profiles to illustrate when and how different costs are incurred, such
as bulk data encryption, public key encryption, private key decryption, and MAC-based verification. We show that using TLS can reduce performance by up to a factor of 20 compared to the typical case of SIP over UDP. The primary factor in determining performance is whether and how TLS connection establishment is performed, due to the heavy
costs of RSA operations used for session negotiation. This depends both on how the SIP proxy is deployed (e.g., as an inbound or
outbound proxy) and what TLS options are used (e.g., mutual authentication, session reuse). The cost of symmetric key operations
such as AES or 3DES, in contrast, tends to be small.
Network operators deploying SIP over TLS should attempt to maximize the persistence of secure connections, and will need
to assess the server resources required. To aid them, we provide a measurement-driven cost model for use in provisioning SIP
servers using TLS. Our cost model predicts performance within 15 percent on average.</td>

emphasis on the use of parallelism to improve performance.
The present and growing diversity in hardware architectures
and software environments, however, continues to
pose difficulties in the effective use of parallelism thus delaying
a quick and smooth transition to the concurrency era.
In this paper, we describe the research being conducted at
Columbia University on a system called COMPASS that aims
to simplify this transition by providing advice to programmers
while they reengineer their code for parallelism. The
advice proffered to the programmer is based on the wisdom
collected from programmers who have already parallelized
some similar code. The utility of COMPASS rests, not only
on its ability to collect the wisdom unintrusively but also on
its ability to automatically seek, find and synthesize this wisdom
into advice that is tailored to the task at hand, i.e., the
code the user is considering parallelizing and the environment
in which the optimized program is planned to execute.
COMPASS provides a platform and an extensible framework
for sharing human expertise about code parallelization –
widely, and on diverse hardware and software. By leveraging
the “wisdom of crowds” model [26], which has been
conjectured to scale exponentially and which has successfully
worked for wikis, COMPASS aims to enable rapid propagation
of knowledge about code parallelization in the context
of the actual parallelization reengineering, and thus
continue to extend the benefits of Moore’s law scaling to
science and society.</td>

strong social ties such as friends. Some legitimate calls, however, are from those with weak social ties such as a restaurant the callee booked a table on-line. Since a callee&#039;s contact list usually contains only the addresses of persons or organizations with strong social ties, filtering out unsolicited calls using the contact list is prone to false positives. To reduce these false positives, we first analyzed call logs and identified that legitimate calls are initiated from persons or organizations with weak social ties through transactions over
the web or email exchanges. This paper proposes two approaches to label incoming calls by using cross-media relations to previous contact mechanisms which initiate the calls. One approach is that potential callers offer the callee their contact addresses which might be used in future correspondence. Another is that a callee provides potential callers with weakly-secret information that the callers should use in
future correspondence in order to identify them as someone the callee has contacted before through other means. Depending on previous contact mechanisms, the callers use either customized contact addresses or message identifiers. The latter approach enables a callee to label incoming calls even without caller identifiers. Reducing false positives during filtering using our proposed approaches will contribute
to the reduction in SPIT (SPam over Internet Telephony).</td>

our knowledge, this is one of the first uses of web scripting that
enhances overall security.  F3ildCrypt uses proxy re-encryption
to re-target messages as they enter and cross SOA boundaries, and uses
XACML, the XML-based access control language, to define protection
policies.  Our approach scales well in the number of public key
operations required for web clients and does not reveal proprietary
details of the logical enterprise network (because of the application
of proxy re-encryption).  We evaluate F3ildCrypt and show an
additional cost of 40 to 150 ms when making sensitive transactions
from the web browser, and a processing rate of 100 to 140 XML
fields/second on the server.  We believe such costs to be a reasonable
tradeoff for increased sensitive-data confidentiality.</td>

A number of approaches have been proposed to detect nefarious insider actions including user modeling and profiling techniques, policy and access enforcement techniques, and misuse detection. In this work we propose trap-based defense mechanisms for the case where insiders attempt to exfiltrate and use sensitive information. Our goal is to confuse and confound the attacker requiring far more effort to identify real information from bogus information and to provide a means of detecting when an inside attacker attempts to exploit sensitive information. ``Decoy Documents&quot; are automatically generated and stored on a file system with the aim of enticing a malicious insider to open and review the contents of the documents. The decoy documents contain several different types of bogus credentials that when used, trigger an alert.  We also embed ``stealthy beacons&quot; inside the documents that cause a signal to be emitted to a server indicating when and where the particular decoy was opened. We evaluate decoy documents on honeypots penetrated by attackers demonstrating the feasibility of the method.</td>

Recently, metamorphic testing has been shown to be a simple yet effective technique in addressing the quality assurance of these so-called &quot;non-testable programs&quot;. In metamorphic testing, existing test case input is modified to produce new test cases in such a manner that, when given the new input, the function should produce an output that can easily be computed based on the original output. That is, if input x produces output f(x), then we create input x&#039; such that we can predict f(x&#039;) based on f(x); if the application does not produce the expected output, then a defect must exist, and either f(x) or f(x&#039;) (or both) is wrong.

Previously we have presented an approach called &quot;Automated Metamorphic System Testing&quot;, in which metamorphic testing is conducted automatically as the program executes. In the approach, metamorphic properties of the entire application are specified, and then checked after execution is complete. Here, we improve upon that work by presenting a technique in which the metamorphic properties of individual functions are used, allowing for the specification of more complex properties and enabling finer-grained runtime checking. Our goal is to demonstrate that such an approach will be more effective than one based on specifying metamorphic properties at the system level, and is also feasible for use in the deployment environment.

This technique, called Metamorphic Runtime Checking, is a system testing approach in which the metamorphic properties of individual functions are automatically checked during the program&#039;s execution. The tester is able to easily specify the functions&#039; properties so that metamorphic testing can be conducted in a running application, allowing the tests to execute using real input data and in the context of real system states, without affecting those states. We also describe an implementation framework called Columbus, and present the results of empirical studies that demonstrate that checking the metamorphic properties of individual functions increases the effectiveness of the approach in detecting defects, with minimal performance impact.</td>

an increasingly more complex functionality, it is becoming clear that
the challenges of such systems are not solely associated to their
synthesis and recognition capabilities. Rather, issues such as the
coordination of turn exchanges between system and user, or the correct
generation and understanding of words that may convey multiple meanings,
appear to play an important role in system usability. This thesis
explores those two issues in the Columbia Games Corpus, a collection
of spontaneous task-oriented dialogues in Standard American English.

We provide evidence of the existence of seven turn-yielding cues --
prosodic, acoustic and syntactic events strongly associated with
conversational turn endings -- and show that the likelihood of a
turn-taking attempt from the interlocutor increases linearly with the
number of cues conjointly displayed by the speaker. We present similar
results related to six backchannel-inviting cues -- events that invite
the interlocutor to produce a short utterance conveying continued
attention.

Additionally, we describe a series of studies of affirmative cue words
-- a family of cue words such as &#039;okay&#039; or &#039;alright&#039; that speakers use
frequently in conversation for several purposes: for acknowledging what
the interlocutor has said, or for cueing the start of a new topic,
among others. We find differences in the acoustic/prosodic realization
of such functions, but observe that contextual information figures
prominently in human disambiguation of these words. We also conduct
machine learning experiments to explore the automatic classification of
affirmative cue words. Finally, we examine a novel measure of speaker
entrainment related to the usage of these words, showing its association
with task success and dialogue coordination.</td>

In metamorphic testing, existing test case input is modified to produce new test cases in such a manner that, when given the new input, the application should produce an output that can be easily be computed based on the original output. That is, if input x produces output f (x), then we create input x&#039; such that we can predict f (x&#039;) based on f(x); if the application does not produce the expected output, then a defect must exist, and either f (x) or f (x&#039;) (or both) is wrong. 

In practice, however, metamorphic testing can be a manually intensive technique for all but the simplest cases. The transformation of input data can be laborious for large data sets, or practically impossible for input that is not in human-readable format. Similarly, comparing the outputs can be error-prone for large result sets, especially when slight variations in the results are not actually indicative of errors (i.e., are false positives), for instance when there is non-determinism in the application and multiple outputs can be considered correct.

In this paper, we present an approach called Automated Metamorphic System Testing. This involves the automation of metamorphic testing at the system level by checking that the metamorphic properties of the entire application hold after its execution. The tester is able to easily set up and conduct metamorphic tests with little manual intervention, and testing can continue in the field with minimal impact
on the user. Additionally, we present an approach called Heuristic Metamorphic Testing which seeks to reduce false positives and address some cases of non-determinism. We also describe an implementation framework called Amsterdam, and present the results of empirical studies in which we demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique on real-world programs without test oracles.</td>

but important task, which has implications for increasing
designer, operator and end-user confidence in
these systems. During design system architects benefit from
tools and techniques that enhance their understanding of
the system, allowing them to reason about the tradeoffs
of proposed or existing self-healing mechanisms and the
overall effectiveness of the system as a result of different
mechanism-compositions. At deployment time, system integrators
and operators need to understand how the selfhealing
mechanisms work and how their operation impacts
the system’s reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS)
in order to cope with any limitations of these mechanisms
when the system is placed into production.

In this paper we construct an evaluation framework for selfhealing
systems around simple, yet powerful, probabilistic
models that capture the behavior of the system’s selfhealing
mechanisms from multiple perspectives (designer,
operator, and end-user). We combine these analytical models
with runtime fault-injection to study the operation of
VM-Rejuv – a virtual machine based rejuvenation scheme
for web-application servers. We use the results from the
fault-injection experiments and model-analysis to reason
about the efficacy of VM-Rejuv, its limitations and strategies
for managing/mitigating these limitations in systemdeployments.
Whereas we use VM-Rejuv as the subject of
our evaluation in this paper, our main contribution is a
practical evaluation approach that can be generalized to
other self-healing systems.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Managing many computers is difficult. Recent virtualization trends exacerbate this problem by making it easy to create and deploy multiple virtual appliances per physical machine, each of which can be configured with different applications and utilities. This results in a huge scaling problem for large organizations as management overhead grows linearly with the number of appliances.

To address this problem, we present Strata, a system that introduces the Virtual Layered File System (VLFS) and integrates it with virtual appliances to simplify system management. Unlike a traditional file system, which is a monolithic entity, a VLFS is a collection of individual software layers composed together to provide the traditional file system view. Individual layers are maintained in a central repository and shared across all VLFSs that use them. Layer changes and upgrades only need to be done once in the repository and are then automatically propagated to all VLFSs, resulting in management overhead independent of the number of virtual appliances. We have implemented a Strata Linux prototype without any application or operating system kernel changes. Using this prototype, we demonstrate how Strata enables fast system provisioning, simplifies system maintenanc and upgrades, speeds system recovery from security exploits, and incurs only modest performance overhead.</td>

Because of the need for subjective study in the design of video compression algorithms it is essential that flexible yet computationally efficient tools be developed.

For this project, we plan to implement a MPEG standard using the SHIM programming language. The SHIM is a software/hardware integration language whose aim is to provide communication between hardware and software while providing deterministic concurrency.

The focus of this project will be to emphasize the efficiency of the SHIM language in embedded applications as compared to other existing implementations.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">First, we will present an approach called Automated Metamorphic System Testing. This will involve automating system-level metamorphic testing by treating the application as a black box and checking that the metamorphic properties of the entire application hold after execution. This will allow for metamorphic testing to be conducted in the production environment without affecting the user, and will not require the tester to have access to the source code. The tests do not require an oracle upon their creation; rather, the metamorphic properties act as built-in test oracles. We will also introduce an implementation framework called Amsterdam.

Second, we will present a new type of testing called Metamorphic Runtime Checking. This involves the execution of metamorphic tests from within the application, i.e., the application launches its own tests, within its current context. The tests execute within the application’s current state, and in particular check a function’s metamorphic properties. We will also present a system called Columbus that supports the execution of the Metamorphic Runtime Checking from within the context of the running application. Like Amsterdam, it will conduct the tests with acceptable performance overhead, and will ensure that the execution of the tests does not affect the state of the original application process from the users’ perspective; however, the  implementation of Columbus will be more challenging in that it will require more sophisticated mechanisms for conducting the tests without pre-empting the rest of the application, and for comparing the results
which may conceivably be in different processes or environments.

Third, we will describe a set of metamorphic testing guidelines that can be followed to assist in the formulation and specification of metamorphic properties that can be used with the above approaches. These will categorize the different types of properties exhibited by many applications in the domain of machine learning and data mining in particular (as a result of the types of applications we will investigate), but we will demonstrate that they are also generalizable to other domains as well. This set of guidelines will also correlate to the different types of defects that we expect the approaches will be able to find.</td>

Data Races and Deadlocks are two major problems with concurrent programs. SHIM is a concurrent programming language that guarantees absence of data races through its semantics. However, a program written in SHIM can deadlock if not carefully written. 

 In this paper, we present a divide-and-merge technique to statically detect deadlocks in SHIM. SHIM is asynchronous, but we can greatly reduce its state space without loosing precision because of its semantics.</td>

We propose mechanism to tune the code generated by the SHIM compiler to enable optimizing compilers to generate structured code.

Although, the discussion here is related to optimizing SHIM IR (Intermediate Representation) code, the techniques discussed here can be incorporated into compilers to convert unstructured loops consisting of goto statements to structured loops such as while and do-while statements to ease back end compiler optimizations.

Our research based SHIM compiler takes the code written in SHIM language and performs various static analysis and finally transforms it into C code. This generated code is compiled to binary using standard compilers available for IBM cell processor such as GCC and IBM XL compiler.</td>

concurrent programming languages. They are usually implemented using
primitive communication mechanisms and thus spare the programmer from
reasoning about low-level implementation details such as remote
procedure calls and error conditions.

Clocks provide flexibility, but programs often use them in specific
ways that do not require their full implementation. In this paper, we
describe a tool that mitigates the overhead of general-purpose clocks
by statically analyzing how programs use them and choosing optimized
implementations when available.

We tackle the clock implementation in the standard library of the X10
programming language---a parallel, distributed object-oriented
language. We report our findings for a small set of analyses and
benchmarks. Our tool only adds a few seconds to analysis time, making
it practical to use as part of a compilation chain.</td>

Borrowing ideas from democracy, our training phase allows each training instance to vote for an equal number of candidate size-2 patterns. Similar to the usual democratic election process, where voters select candidates by considering their qualifications, prior contributions at the constituency and territory levels, as well as their own perception about candidates, the training instances select patterns by effectively balancing between local, class, and global significance of patterns. In addition, we respect &quot;each voter&#039;s opinion&quot; by simultaneously adding shared patterns to all applicable classes, and then apply a novel power law based weighing scheme, instead of making binary decisions on these patterns.

Results of experiments performed on 121 common text and web datasets show that our algorithm almost always outperforms state of the art classification algorithms, without requiring any dataset-specific parameter tuning. On 100 real-life, noisy, web datasets, the average absolute classification accuracy improvement was as great as 10% over SVM, Harmony, C4.5 and KNN. Also, our algorithm ran about 3.5 times faster than the fastest existing pattern-based classification algorithm.</td>

Bugs such as security vulnerabilities, file storage issues, deadlocks and data races can occur anywhere in the state space and are often triggered by corner cases; therefore, it becomes important to explore and model check all runtime choices. However, large and complex software systems generate huge numbers of behaviors leading to ‘state explosion’. eXplode is a lightweight, deterministic and depth-bound model checker that explores all dynamic choices at runtime. Given an application-specific test-harness, eXplode performs state search in a serialized fashion - which limits its scalability and performance. This paper proposes a distributed eXplode engine that uses multiple host machines concurrently in order to achieve more state space coverage in less time, and is very helpful to scale up the software verification and validation effort. Test results show that Distributed eXplode runs several times faster and covers more state space than the standalone eXplode.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We propose the concept of a generalized assorted pixel (GAP) camera, which enables the user to
capture a single image of a scene and, after the fact, control the trade-off between spatial resolution,
dynamic range and spectral detail. The GAP camera uses a complex array (or mosaic) of color filters.
A major problem with using such an array is that the captured image is severely under-sampled for at
least some of the filter types. This leads to reconstructed images with strong aliasing. We make three
contributions in this paper: (a) We present a comprehensive optimization method to arrive at the spatial
and spectral layout of the color filter array of a GAP camera. (b) We develop a novel anti-aliasing
algorithm for reconstructing the under-sampled channels of the image with minimal aliasing. (c) We
demonstrate how the user can capture a single image and then control the trade-off of spatial resolution
to generate a variety of images, including monochrome, high dynamic range (HDR) monochrome, RGB,
HDR RGB, and multispectral images. Finally, the performance of our GAP camera has been verified using extensive simulations that use multispectral images of real world scenes. A large database of these multispectral images is being made publicly available for use by the research community.</td>

However, multicast service discovery protocols are considered to generate network traffic overhead, especially in a wireless network. Therefore, it becomes important to evaluate the traffic and overhead caused by multicast service discovery packets in real-world networks. We measure and analyze the traffic of one of the mostly deployed multicast service discovery protocols, multicast DNS (mDNS) service discovery, in a campus wireless network that forms a single multicast domain of large users. We also analyze different service discovery models in terms of packet overhead and service discovery delay under different network sizes and churn rates. Our measurement shows that mDNS traffic consumes about 13 percent of the total bandwidth.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">As machine learning (ML) applications become prevalent in various aspects of everyday life, their dependability takes on
increasing importance. It is challenging to test such applications, however, because they are intended to learn properties of data sets
where the correct answers are not already known. Our work is not concerned with testing how well an ML algorithm learns, but rather
seeks to ensure that an application using the algorithm implements the specification correctly and fulfills the users&#039; expectations. These
are critical to ensuring the application&#039;s dependability. This paper presents three approaches to testing these types of applications.
In the first, we create a set of limited test cases for which it is, in fact, possible to predict what the correct output should be. In
the second approach, we use random testing to generate large data sets according to parameterization based on the application’s
equivalence classes. Our third approach is based on metamorphic testing, in which properties of the application are exploited to define
transformation functions on the input, such that the new output can easily be predicted based on the original output. Here we discuss
these approaches, and our findings from testing the dependability of three real-world ML applications.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Currently deployed IEEE 802.11WLANs (Wi-Fi networks) share access point (AP) bandwidth on a per-packet basis. However, the various stations communicating with the AP often have different signal qualities, resulting in different transmission rates. This induces a phenomenon known as the rate anomaly problem, in which stations with lower signal
quality transmit at lower rates and consume a significant majority of airtime, thereby dramatically reducing the throughput of stations transmitting at high rates. We propose a practical, deployable system, called SoftRepeater, in which stations cooperatively address the rate
anomaly problem. Specifically, higher-rate Wi-Fi stations opportunistically transformthemselves into repeaters for stations
with low data-rates when transmitting to/from the AP. The key challenge is to determine when it is beneficial to enable the repeater functionality. In this paper, we propose an initiation protocol that ensures that repeater functionality is enabled only when appropriate. Also, our system can run directly on top of today’s 802.11 infrastructure networks. We also describe a novel, zero-overhead network coding scheme that further alleviates undesirable symptoms of the rate anomaly problem. We evaluate our system using simulation and testbed implementation, and find that SoftRepeater can improve cumulative throughput by up to 200%.</td>

                      The 7U Evaluation Method: Evaluating Software Systems via Runtime Fault-Injection and Reliability, Availability and Serviceability (RAS) Metrics and Models

                    <td class="col-md-2">Renewed interest in developing computing systems that meet additional non-functional requirements such as reliability, high availability and ease-of-management/self-management (serviceability) has fueled research into developing systems that exhibit enhanced reliability,
availability and serviceability (RAS) capabilities. This research focus on enhancing the RAS capabilities of computing systems impacts not only the legacy/existing systems we have today, but also has implications for the design and development of next generation (self-
managing/self-*) systems, which are expected to meet these non-functional requirements with minimal human intervention.

To reason about the RAS capabilities of the systems of today or the self-* systems of tomorrow, there are three evaluation-related challenges to address. First, developing (or identifying) practical fault-injection tools that can be used to study the failure behavior of
computing systems and exercise any (remediation) mechanisms the system has available for mitigating or resolving problems. Second, identifying techniques that can be used to quantify RAS deficiencies in computing systems and reason about the e&amp;#64259;cacy of individual or combined RAS-enhancing mechanisms (at design-time or after system deployment).
Third, developing an evaluation methodology that can be used to objectively compare systems based on the (expected or actual) bene&amp;#64257;ts of RAS-enhancing mechanisms.

This thesis addresses these three challenges by introducing the 7U Evaluation Methodology, a complementary approach to traditional performance-centric evaluations that identifies criteria for comparing and analyzing existing (or yet-to-be-added) RAS-enhancing mechanisms,
is able to evaluate and reason about combinations of mechanisms, exposes under-performing mechanisms and highlights the lack of mechanisms in a rigorous, objective and quantitative
manner.

The development of the 7U Evaluation Methodology is based on the following three hypotheses. First, that runtime adaptation provides a platform for implementing e&amp;#64259;cient and &amp;#64258;exible fault-injection tools capable of in-situ and in-vivo interactions with computing systems. Second, that mathematical models such as Markov chains, Markov reward networks and Control theory models can successfully be used to create simple, reusable templates for describing speci&amp;#64257;c failure scenarios and scoring the system’s responses, i.e., studying the failure-behavior of systems, and the various facets of its remediation mechanisms and
their impact on system operation. Third, that combining practical fault-injection tools with mathematical modeling techniques based on Markov Chains, Markov Reward Networks and Control Theory can be used to develop a benchmarking methodology for evaluating and comparing the reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) characteristics of computing systems.

This thesis demonstrates how the 7U Evaluation Method can be used to evaluate the RAS capabilities of real-world computing systems and in so doing makes three contributions. First, a suite of runtime fault-injection tools (Kheiron tools) able to work in a variety
of execution environments is developed. Second, analytical tools that can be used to construct mathematical models (RAS models) to evaluate and quantify RAS capabilities using appropriate metrics are discussed. Finally, the results and insights gained from conducting fault-injection experiments on real-world systems and modeling the system
responses (or lack thereof) using RAS models are presented. In conducting 7U Evaluations of real-world systems, this thesis highlights the similarities and differences between traditional performance-oriented evaluations and RAS-oriented evaluations and outlines a general
framework for conducting RAS evaluations.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Software products released into the field typically have
some number of residual defects that either were not detected
or could not have been detected during testing. This
may be the result of flaws in the test cases themselves, incorrect
assumptions made during the creation of test cases,
or the infeasibility of testing the sheer number of possible
configurations for a complex system; these defects may also
be due to application states that were not considered during
lab testing, or corrupted states that could arise due to
a security violation. One approach to this problem is to
continue to test these applications even after deployment,
in hopes of finding any remaining flaws. In this paper, we
present a testing methodology we call in vivo testing, in
which tests are continuously executed in the deployment
environment. We also describe a type of test we call in
vivo tests that are specifically designed for use with such
an approach: these tests execute within the current state of
the program (rather than by creating a clean slate) without
affecting or altering that state from the perspective of the
end-user. We discuss the approach and the prototype testing
framework for Java applications called Invite. We also
provide the results of case studies that demonstrate Invite’s
effectiveness and efficiency.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">It is challenging to test applications and functions for which the correct output for arbitrary input cannot be known in advance, e.g. some computational science or machine learning applications. In the absence of a test oracle, one approach to testing these applications is to use metamorphic testing: existing test case input is modified to produce new test cases in such a manner that, when given the new input, the application should produce an output that can be easily be computed based on the original output. That is, if input x produces output f(x), then we create input x&#039; such that we can predict f(x&#039;) based on f(x); if the application or function does not produce the expected output, then a defect must exist, and either f(x) or f(x&#039;) (or both) is wrong. By using metamorphic testing, we are able to provide built-in &quot;pseudo-oracles&quot; for these so-called &quot;nontestable programs&quot; that have no test oracles. In this paper, we describe an approach in which a function&#039;s
metamorphic properties are specified using an extension to the Java Modeling Language (JML), a behavioral interface specification language that is used to support the &quot;design by contract&quot; paradigm in Java applications. Our implementation, called Corduroy, pre-processes these specifications and generates test code that can be executed using JML runtime assertion checking, for ensuring that the specifications hold during program execution. In addition to presenting our approach and implementation, we also describe our findings from case studies in which we apply our technique to applications without test oracles.</td>

Port 80 is the gateway to many application level services and a large array of attacks are channeled through this vector, servers cannot easily firewall this port. Signature-based sensors are effective in filtering known exploits but can’t detect 0-day vulnerabilities or deal with polymorphism and statistical AD approaches have mostly been limited to network layer, protocol-agnostic modeling, weakening their effectiveness. N -gram based modeling approaches have recently demonstrated success but the ill-posed nature of modeling large grams have thus far prevented exploration of higher order statistical models. In this paper, we provide a solution to this problem based on a factorization into Markov-chains and aim to model higher order structure as well as content for web requests. Spectrogram is implemented in a protocol-aware, passive, network-situated, but CGI-layered, AD architecture and we show in our evaluation that this model demonstrates significant detection results on an array of real world web-layer attacks, achieving at least 97% detection rates on all but one dataset and comparing favorably against other AD sensors.</td>

identifying the IP address of Tor clients. We approximate
an almost-global passive adversary (GPA) capable of eavesdropping
anywhere in the network by using LinkWidth, a novel bandwidth-estimation technique. LinkWidth allows network edge-attached entities to estimate the available bandwidth in an arbitrary Internet link without a cooperating peer host, router, or ISP. By modulating the bandwidth of an anonymous connection (e.g., when the destination server
or its router is under our control), we can observe these fluctuations
as they propagate through the Tor network and the Internet to the end-user’s IP address. Our technique exploits one of the design criteria for Tor (trading off GPA-resistance for improved latency/bandwidth over MIXes) by allowing well-provisioned (in terms of bandwidth) adversaries to effectively become GPAs.

Although timing-based attacks have been demonstrated
against non-timing-preserving anonymity networks, they have
depended either on a global passive adversary or on the compromise
of a substantial number of Tor nodes. Our technique
does not require compromise of any Tor nodes or collaboration
of the end-server (for some scenarios). We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach in tracking the IP address
of Tor users in a series of experiments. Even for an underprovisioned
adversary with only two network vantage points, we can identify the end user (IP address) in many cases.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The regulation of gene expression plays a central role in the development and function of a living cell. A complex network of interacting regulatory proteins bind specific sequence elements in the genome to control the amount and timing of gene expression. The abundance of genome-scale datasets from different organisms provides an opportunity to accelerate our understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation. Developing computational tools to infer gene regulation programs from high-throughput genomic data is one of the central problems in computational biology.

In this thesis, we present a new predictive modeling framework for studying gene regulation. We formulate the problem of learning regulatory programs as a binary classification task: to accurately predict the the condition-specific activation (up-regulation) and repression (down-regulation) of gene expression. The gene expression response is measured by microarray expression data. Genes are represented by various genomic regulatory sequence features. Experimental conditions are represented by the gene expression levels of various regulatory proteins. We use this combination of features to learn a prediction function for the regulatory response of genes under different experimental conditions. The core computational approach is based on boosting. Boosting algorithms allow us to learn high-accuracy, large-margin classifiers and avoid overfitting. We describe three applications of our framework to study gene regulation:

- In the GeneClass algorithm, we use a compendium of known transcription factor binding sites and gene expression data to learn a global context-specific regulation program that accurately predicts differential expression. GeneClass learns a prediction function in the form of an alternating decision tree, a margin-based generalization of a decision tree. We introduce a novel robust variant of boosting that improves stability and biological interpretability in the presence of correlated features. We also show how to incorporate genome-wide protein-DNA binding data from ChIP-chip experiments into the framework.
- In several organisms, the DNA binding sites of many transcription factors are unknown. Hence, automatic discovery of regulatory sequence motifs is required. In the MEDUSA algorithm, we integrate raw promoter sequence data and gene expression data to simultaneously discover cis regulatory motifs ab initio and learn predictive regulatory programs. MEDUSA automatically learns probabilistic representations of motifs and their corresponding target genes. We show that we are able to accurately learn the binding sites of most known transcription factors in yeast.
- We also design new techniques for extracting biologically and statistically significant information from the learned regulatory models. We use a margin-based score to extract global condition-specific regulomes as well as cluster-specific and gene-specific regulation programs. We develop a post-processing framework for interpreting and visualizing biological information encapsulated in our models.

We show the utility of our framework in analyzing several interesting biological contexts (environmental stress responses, DNA-damage response and hypoxia-response) in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also show that our methods can learn regulatory programs and cis regulatory motifs in higher eukaryotes such as worms and humans. Several hypotheses generated by our methods are validated by our collaborators using biochemical experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework is quantitatively and qualitatively predictive. We are able to achieve high prediction accuracy on test data and also generate specific, testable hypotheses.</td>

Second, we believe that this approach can further be extended to applications for which there is no test oracle by using a variant of metamorphic testing at runtime.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The usage of voice over IP (VoIP) traffic in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks is expected to increase in the near future due to widely deployed 802.11 wireless networks and VoIP services on fixed lines. However, the quality of service (QoS) of VoIP traffic in wireless networks is still unsatisfactory. In this thesis, I identify several sources for the QoS problems of VoIP traffic in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks and propose solutions for these problems.

The QoS problems discussed can be divided into three categories, namely, user mobility, VoIP capacity, and call admission control. User mobility causes network disruptions during handoffs. In order to reduce the handoff time between Access Points (APs), I propose a new handoff algorithm, Selective Scanning and Caching, which finds available APs by scanning a minimum number of channels and furthermore allows clients to perform handoffs without scanning, by caching AP information. I also describe a new architecture for the client and server side for seamless IP layer handoffs, which are caused when mobile clients change the subnet due to layer 2 handoffs. 

I also present two methods to improve VoIP capacity for 802.11 networks, Adaptive Priority Control (APC) and Dynamic Point Coordination Function (DPCF). APC is a new packet scheduling algorithm at the AP and improves the capacity by balancing the uplink and downlink delay of VoIP traffic, and DPCF uses a polling based protocol and minimizes the bandwidth wasted from unnecessary polling, using a dynamic polling list. Additionally, I estimated the capacity for VoIP traffic in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks via theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments in a wireless test-bed and show how to avoid mistakes in the measurements and comparisons.

Finally, to protect the QoS for existing VoIP calls while maximizing the channel utilization, I propose a novel admission control algorithm called QP-CAT (Queue size Prediction using Computation of Additional Transmission), which accurately predicts the impact of new voice calls by virtually transmitting virtual new VoIP traffic.</td>

&quot;American Idol&quot; style flash crowd effects or denial of service
attacks. The SIP server overload problem is interesting especially
because the costs of serving or rejecting a SIP session can be
similar. For this reason, the built-in SIP
overload control mechanism based on generating rejection messages
cannot prevent the server from entering congestion collapse under
heavy load. The SIP overload problem calls for a pushback control
solution in which the potentially overloaded receiving server may
notify its upstream sending servers to have them send only the
amount of load within the receiving server&#039;s processing capacity.
The pushback framework can be achieved by SIP application layer rate-based
feedback or window-based feedback. The centerpiece of the
feedback mechanism is the algorithm used to generate load
regulation information. We propose three new window-based feedback
algorithms and evaluate them together with two existing rate-based
feedback algorithms. We compare the different algorithms in terms
of the number of tuning parameters and performance under both steady
and variable load. Furthermore, we identify two categories of
fairness requirements for SIP overload control, namely,
user-centric and provider-centric fairness. With the introduction
of a new double-feed SIP overload control architecture, we show
how the algorithms meet those fairness criteria.</td>

make their algorithms and databases available for community use, but
their own computational resources may be inadequate to fulfill
external user demand -- yet the system&#039;s footprint is far too large
for prospective user organizations to download and run locally.  Some
heavyweight systems have become part of designated ``centers&#039;&#039;

substantial government funding; others use virtual supercomputers
dispersed across grids formed by massive numbers of volunteer

computation units. We have identified a class of scientific computing
systems where ``utility&#039;&#039; sub-jobs can be offloaded to any of several

                    <td class="col-md-2">The lack of fair bandwidth allocation in Peer-to-Peer systems causes
 many performance problems, including users being disincentivized from
contributing upload bandwidth, free riders taking as much from the
system as possible while contributing as little as possible, and a
lack of quality-of-service guarantees to support streaming
applications.  We present FairTorrent, a simple distributed scheduling
algorithm for Peer-to-Peer systems that fosters fair bandwidth
allocation among peers.  For each peer, FairTorrent maintains a deficit
counter which represents the number of bytes uploaded to a peer minus
the number of bytes downloaded from it.  It then uploads to the peer
with the lowest deficit counter.  FairTorrent automatically adjusts to
variations in bandwidth among peers and is resilient to exploitation
by free-riding peers.  We have implemented FairTorrent inside a BitTorrent client without modifications to the BitTorrent protocol, and compared its performance on PlanetLab against other widely-used BitTorrent clients.  Our results show that FairTorrent can provide up to two orders of magnitude better fairness and up to five times better download performance for high contributing peers.  It thereby gives users an incentive to contribute more bandwidth, and improve overall system performance.</td>

as a popular means of data distribution. However, conventional
uses of P2P networking involve distributing stored
files for use after the entire file has been downloaded. In
this work, we investigate whether P2P networking can be
used to provide real-time playback capabilities for stored
media. For real-time playback, users should be able to start
playback immediately, or almost immediately, after requesting
the media and have uninterrupted playback during the
download. To achieve this goal, it is critical to efficiently
schedule the order in which pieces of the desired media
are downloaded. Simply downloading pieces in sequential
(earliest-first) order is prone to bottlenecks. Consequently
we propose a hybrid of earliest-first and rarest-first scheduling
- ensuring high piece diversity while at the same time
prioritizing pieces needed to maintain uninterrupted playback.
We consider an approach to peer-assisted streaming
that is based on BitTorrent. In particular, we show that dynamic
adjustment of the probabilities of earliest-first and
rarest-first strategies along with utilization of coding techniques
promoting higher data diversity, can offer noticeable
improvements for real-time playback.</td>

We use both predicted and actual query execution times for learning,

a state-of-the-art query optimizer for some workloads.  ReoptSMART
realizes savings not only in optimization time, but also in query

                    <td class="col-md-2">This paper presents one-class Hellinger distance-based and one-class SVM modeling techniques that use a set of features to reveal user intent. The specific objective is to model user command profiles and detect deviations indicating a masquerade attack. The approach aims to model user intent, rather than only modeling sequences of user issued commands.  We hypothesize that each individual user will search in a targeted and limited fashion in order to find information germane to their current task. Masqueraders, on the other hand, will likely not know the file system and layout of another user&#039;s desktop, and would likely search more extensively and broadly. Hence, modeling a user search behavior to detect deviations may more accurately detect masqueraders. To that end, we extend prior research that uses UNIX command sequences issued by users as the audit source by relying upon an abstraction of commands. We devised a taxonomy of UNIX commands that is used to abstract command sequences.  The experimental results show that the approach does not lose information and performs comparably to or slightly better than the modeling approach based on simple UNIX command frequencies.</td>

In order to enhance current NAC technologies, we propose a new architecture based on behaviors rather than roles or identity, where the policies are automatically learned and updated over time by the members of the network in order to adapt to behavioral
changes of the devices. Behavior pro&amp;#64257;les may be presented as identity cards that can change over time. By incorporating an Anomaly Detector (AD) to the NAC server or to each of the hosts, their behavior pro&amp;#64257;le is
modeled and used to determine the type of behaviors that should be accepted within the network. These models constitute behavior-based policies. In our enhanced NAC architecture, global decisions are made using a group voting process. Each host’s behavior pro&amp;#64257;le is used to compute a partial decision for or against the acceptance of a new pro&amp;#64257;le or traf&amp;#64257;c. The aggregation of these partial votes amounts to the model-group decision. This voting process makes the architecture more resilient to attacks. Even after accepting a certain percentage of malicious devices, the enhanced NAC is able to compute an adequate decision. We provide proof-of-concept experiments of our architecture using web traf&amp;#64257;c from our department network. Our results show that the model-group decision approach based on behavior pro&amp;#64257;les has a 99% detection rate of anomalous traf&amp;#64257;c with a false positive rate of
only 0.005%. Furthermore, the architecture achieves short latencies for both the pre- and post-connect phases.</td>

mechanisms for defining security policies in these networks have not
kept up with the advancements in networking technology.  In most
cases, system administrators must define policies on a per-application
basis, and subsequently, these policies do not interact.  For example,
there is no mechanism that allows a firewall to communicate decisions
based on its ruleset to a web server behind it, even though decisions
being made at the firewall may be relevant to decisions made at the
web server.  In this paper, we describe a path-based access control
system which allows applications in a network to pass
access-control-related information to neighboring applications, as the
applications process requests from outsiders and from each other.
This system defends networks against a class of attacks wherein
individual applications may make correct access control decisions but
the resulting network behavior is incorrect.  We demonstrate the
system on service-oriented architecture (SOA)-style networks, in two
forms, using graph-based policies, and leveraging the KeyNote trust
management system.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We study $d$-variate approximation for a weighted unanchored Sobolev
  space having smoothness $m\ge1$.  Folk wisdom would lead us to believe
  that this problem should become easier as its smoothness increases.  This
  is true if we are only concerned with asymptotic analysis: the $n$th
  minimal error is of order~$n^{-(m-\delta)}$ for any $\delta&gt;0$.  However,
  it is unclear how long we need to wait before this asymptotic behavior
  kicks in.  How does this waiting period depend on $d$ and~$m$?  We prove
  that no matter how the weights are chosen, the waiting period is at
  least~$m^d$, even if the error demand~$\varepsilon$ is arbitrarily close
  to~$1$.  Hence, for $m\ge2$, this waiting period is exponential in~$d$,
  so that the problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality and is
  intractable.  In other words, the fact that the asymptotic behavior
  improves with~$m$ is irrelevant when $d$~is large.  So, we will be unable
  to vanquish the curse of dimensionality unless $m=1$, i.e., unless the
  smoothness is minimal.  We then show that our problem \emph{can} be
  tractable if $m=1$.  That is, we can find an $\varepsilon$-approximation
  using polynomially-many (in $d$ and~$\varepsilon^{-1}$) information
  operations, even if only function values are permitted.  When $m=1$, it
  is even possible for the problem to be \emph{strongly} tractable, i.e.,
  we can find an $\varepsilon$-approximation using polynomially-many
  (in~$\varepsilon^{-1}$) information operations, independent of~$d$.
  These positive results hold when the weights of the Sobolev space decay
  sufficiently quickly or are bounded finite-order weights, i.e., the
  $d$-variate functions we wish to approximate can be decomposed as sums of
  functions depending on at most~$\omega$ variables, where $\omega$ is
  independent of~$d$.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">A Spreadable Connected Autonomic Network (SCAN) is a mobile network that automatically maintains its own connectivity as nodes move.  We envision SCANs to enable a diverse set of applications such as self-spreading mesh networks and robotic search and rescue systems.  This paper describes our experiences developing a prototype robotic SCAN built from commercial, off-the-shelf hardware, to support such applications.  A major contribution of our work is the development of a protocol, called SCAN1, which maintains network connectivity by enabling individual nodes to determine when they must constrain their mobility in order to avoid disconnecting the network.  SCAN1 achieves its goal through an entirely distributed process in which individual nodes utilize only local (2-hop) knowledge of the network&#039;s topology to periodically make a simple decision: move, or freeze in place.   Along with experimental results from our hardware testbed, we model SCAN1&#039;s performance, providing both supporting analysis and simulation for the efficacy of SCAN1 as a solution to enable SCANs.  While our evaluation of SCAN1 in this paper is limited to systems whose capabilities match those of our testbed, SCAN1 can be utilized in conjunction with a wide-range of potential applications and environments, as either a primary or backup connectivity maintenance mechanism.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Latency-insensitive design is a methodology for system-on-chip (SoC) design that simplifies the reuse of intellectual property cores and the implementation of the communication among them. This simplification is based on a system-level protocol that decouples the intra-core logic design from the design of the inter-core communication channels. Each core is encapsulated within a shell, a synthesized logic block that dynamically controls its operation to interface it with the rest of the SoC and to absorb any latency variations on its I/O signals. In particular, a shell stalls a core whenever new valid data are not available on the input channels or a down-link core has requested a delay in the data production on the output channels. 

We study how knowledge about the internal logic structure of a core can be applied to the design of its shell to improve the overall system-level performance by avoiding unnecessary local stalling. We introduce the notion of functional independence conditions (FIC) and present a novel circuit design of a generic shell template that can leverage FIC. We propose a procedure for the logic synthesis of a FIC-shell instance that is only based on the analysis of the intra-core logic and does not require any input from the designers. Finally, we present a comprehensive experimental analysis that shows the performance benefits and limited design overhead of the proposed technique. This includes the semi-custom design of an SoC, an ultra-wideband baseband transmitter, using a 90nm industrial standard cell library.</td>

functions on the input, such that the new output will be unchanged or can easily be predicted based on the original output; if the output is not as expected, then a defect must exist in the application. Here, we seek to enumerate and classify the metamorphic properties of some machine learning algorithms, and demonstrate how these can be applied
to reveal defects in the applications of interest. In addition to the results of our testing, we present a set of properties that can be used to define these metamorphic relationships so that metamorphic testing can be used as a general approach to testing machine learning applications.</td>

Our measurements found that using SCTP does not significantly

Partitioning is also fundamental for dividing work into equal-sized (or balanced) parallel subtasks. In this paper, we aim to find, materialize and maintain a set of partitioning elements (splitters) for a data set. Unlike traditional partitioning elements, our splitters define both inequality and equality partitions, which allows us to bound the size of the inequality partitions. We provide an algorithm for determining an optimal set of splitters from a sorted data set and show that it has time complexity O(k lg_2 N), where k is the number of splitters requested and N is the size of the data set. We show how the algorithm can be extended to pairs of tables, so that joins can be partitioned into work units that have balanced cost. We demonstrate experimentally (a) that finding the optimal set of splitters can be done efficiently, and (b) that using the precomputed splitters can improve the time to sort a data set by up to 76%, with particular benefits in the presence of a few heavy hitters.</td>

of services and network conditions.  How does the choice of TCP affect the scalability and performance compared to UDP? We experimentally analyze the impact of using TCP as a transport protocol for a SIP server. We first investigate scalability of a TCP echo server, then compare performance of a SIP server for three TCP connection lifetimes: transaction, dialog, and persistent. Our results show that a Linux machine can establish 450,000+ TCP connections and maintaining connections does not affect the transaction response time. Additionally, the transaction response times using the three TCP connection lifetimes and UDP show no significant difference at 2,500 registration requests/second and at 500 call requests/second. However, sustainable request rate is lower for TCP than for UDP, since using TCP requires more message processing. More message processing causes longer delays at the thread queue for the server implementing a thread-pool model. Finally, we suggest how to reduce the impact of TCP for a scalable SIP server especially under overload control. This is applicable to other servers with very large connection counts.</td>

consequently, on software. However, as the complexity of programs
increase, so does the number of defects within them. To
alleviate the problem, automated techniques are constantly used to
improve software quality. Static analysis is one such approach in
which violations of correctness properties are searched and
reported. Static analysis has many advantages, but it is necessarily
conservative because it symbolically executes the program instead of
using real inputs, and it considers all possible executions
simultaneously. Being conservative often means issuing false alarms,
or missing real program errors.

Pointer variables are a challenging aspect of many languages that can
force static analysis tools to be overly conservative. It is often
unclear what variables are affected by pointer-manipulating
expressions, and aliasing between variables is one of the banes of
program analysis. To alleviate that, a common solution is to allow
the programmer to provide annotations such as declaring a variable
as unaliased in a given scope, or providing special constructs
such as the ``never-null&#039;&#039; pointer of Cyclone. However,
programmers rarely keep these annotations up-to-date.

The solution is to provide some form of pointer analysis, which
derives useful information about pointer variables in the program.  An
appropriate pointer analysis equips the static tool so that it is

This dissertation proposes a methodology for pointer analysis that is
specially tailored for ``modular bug finding.&#039;&#039; It presents a new
analysis space for pointer analysis, defined by finer-grain ``dimensions
of precision,&#039;&#039; which allows us to explore and evaluate a variety of
different algorithms to achieve better trade-offs between analysis
precision and efficiency. This framework is developed around a new
abstraction for computing points-to sets, the Assign-Fetch Graph, that
has many interesting features. Empirical evaluation shows promising
results, as some unknown errors in well-known applications were
discovered.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Embedding malcode within documents provides a convenient means of penetrating systems which may be unreachable by network-level service attacks. Such attacks can be very targeted and difficult to detect compared to the typical network worm threat due to the multitude of document-exchange vectors. Detecting malcode embedded in a document is difficult owing to the complexity of modern document formats that provide ample opportunity to embed code in a myriad of ways. We focus on Microsoft Word documents as malcode carriers as a case study in this paper. We introduce a hybrid system that integrates static and dynamic techniques to detect the presence and location of malware embedded in documents. The system is designed to automatically update its detection models to improve accuracy over time. The overall hybrid detection system with a learning feedback loop is demonstrated to achieve a 99.27% detection rate and 3.16% false positive rate on a corpus of 6228 Word documents.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Software products released into the field typically have some number of residual bugs that either were not detected or could not have been detected during testing. This may be the result of flaws in the test cases themselves, assumptions made during the creation of test cases, or the infeasibility of testing the sheer number of possible configurations for a complex system. Testing approaches such as perpetual testing or continuous testing seek to continue to test these applications even after deployment, in hopes of finding any remaining flaws. In this paper, we present our initial work towards a testing methodology we call in vivo testing, in which unit tests are continuously executed inside a running application in the deployment environment. These tests execute within the current state of the program (rather than by creating a clean slate) without affecting or altering that state. Our approach can reveal defects both in the applications of interest and in the unit tests themselves. It can also be used for detecting concurrency or robustness issues that may not have appeared in a testing lab. Here we describe the approach and the testing framework called Invite that we have developed for Java applications. We also enumerate the classes of bugs our approach can discover, and provide the results of a case study on a publicly-available application, as well as the results of experiments to measure the added overhead.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Even though Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems present a cost-effective and
scalable solution to content distribution, most entertainment, media
and software, content providers continue to rely on expensive,
centralized solutions such as Content Delivery Networks. One of the
main reasons is that the current P2P systems cannot guarantee
reasonable performance as they depend on the willingness of users to
contribute bandwidth. Moreover, even systems like BitTorrent, which
employ a tit-for-tat protocol to encourage fair bandwidth exchange
between users, are prone to free-riding (i.e. peers that do not
upload). Our experiments on PlanetLab extend previous research
(e.g. LargeViewExploit, BitTyrant) demonstrating that
such selfish behavior can seriously degrade the performance of regular
users in many more scenarios beyond simple free-riding: we observed an
overhead of upto 430\% for 80\% of free-riding identities easily
generated by a small set of selfish users.

To mitigate the effects of selfish users, we propose a new P2P
architecture that classifies peers with the help of a small number of
{\em trusted nodes} that we call Trusted Auditors (TAs). TAs
participate in P2P download like regular clients and detect
free-riding identities by observing their neighbors&#039; behavior. Using
TAs, we can separate compliant users into a separate service pool
resulting in better performance. Furthermore, we show that TAs are
more effective ensuring the performance of the system than a mere
increase in bandwidth capacity: for 80\% of free-riding identities a
single-TA system has a 6\% download time overhead while without the
TA and three times the bandwidth capacity we measure a 100\%
overhead.</td>

In a latency-insensitive system (LIS) each core is encapsulated within a shell, a synthesized interface module that dynamically controls its operation.  At each clock period, if new data has not arrived on an input channel or a stalling request has arrived on an output channel, the shell stalls the core and buffers other incoming valid data for future processing.  The combination of finite buffers and backpressure from stalling can cause throughput degradation.  Previous works addressed this problem by increasing buffer space to reduce the backpressure requests or inserting extra buffering to balance the channel latency around a LIS.  We explore the theoretical complexity of these approaches and propose a heuristic algorithm for efficient queue sizing.  We also practically characterize several LIS topologies and how the topology of a LIS can impact not only how much throughput degradation will occur, but also the difficulty of finding optimal queue sizing solutions.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We introduce LinkWidth, a method for estimating capacity and available
bandwidth using single-end controlled TCP packet probes. To estimate
capacity, we generate a train of TCP RST packets ``sandwiched&#039;&#039;
between trains of TCP SYN packets. Capacity is computed from the
end-to-end packet dispersion of the received TCP RST/ACK packets
corresponding to the TCP SYN packets going to closed ports. Our
technique is significantly different from the rest of the packet-pair
based measurement techniques, such as {\em CapProbe,} {\em pathchar}
and {\em pathrate,} because the long packet trains minimize errors due
to bursty cross-traffic. Additionally, TCP RST packets do not generate
additional ICMP replies, thus avoiding cross-traffic due to such
packets from interfering with our probes. In addition, we use TCP
packets for all our probes to prevent QoS-related traffic shaping
(based on packet types) from affecting our measurements (eg. CISCO
routers by default are known have to very high latency while
generating to ICMP TTL expired replies).

We extend the {\it Train of Packet Pairs} technique to approximate the
available link capacity. We use a train of TCP packet pairs with
variable intra-pair delays and sizes. This is the first attempt to
implement this technique using single-end TCP probes, tested on a
range of networks with different bottleneck capacities and cross
traffic rates. The method we use for measuring from a single point of
control uses TCP RST packets between a train of TCP SYN packets. The
idea is quite similar to the technique for measuring the bottleneck
capacity. We compare our prototype with {\em pathchirp,} {\em
pathload,} {\em IPERF,} which require control of both ends as well as
another single end controlled technique {\em abget}, and demonstrate
that in most cases our method gives approximately the same results if
not better.</td>

In this paper we attempt to improve the recall of text search by automatically assigning appropriate tags to models. Our algorithm finds relevant tags by appealing to a large corpus of partially labeled example models, which does not have to be preclassified or otherwise prepared. For this purpose we use a copy of Google 3DWarehouse, a database of user contributed models which is publicly available on the Internet. Given a model to tag, we find geometrically similar models in the corpus, based on distances in a reduced dimensional space derived from Zernike descriptors. The labels of these neighbors are used as tag candidates for the model with probabilities proportional to the degree of geometric similarity. We show experimentally that text based search for 3D models using our computed tags can work as well as geometry based search. Finally, we demonstrate our 3D model search engine that uses this algorithm and discuss some implementation issues.</td>

methodologies.  We illustrate the potential practical benefits of
schema factorization by showing that simple heuristics can

                    <td class="col-md-2">In this paper, we propose a method to program divide-and-conquer problems on multicore systems that is based on a data-driven recursive programming model.  Data intensive programs are difficult to program on multicore architectures because they require efficient utilization of inter-core communication.  Models for programming multicore systems available today generally lack the ability to automatically extract concurrency from a sequential style program and map concurrent tasks to efficiently leverage data and temporal locality.  For divide-and-conquer algorithms, a recursive programming model can address both of these problems.  Furthermore, since a recursive function has the same behavior patterns at all granularities of a problem, the same recursive model can be used to implement a multicore program at all of its levels: 1. the operations of a single core, 2. how to distribute tasks among several cores, and 3. in what order  to schedule tasks on a multicore system when it is not possible to schedule all of the tasks at the same time.  We present a novel selective execution technique that can enable automatic parallelization and task mapping of a recursive program onto a multicore system.  To verify the practicality of this approach, we perform a case-study of bitonic sort on the Cell BE processor.</td>

generic facial motion model which represents deformations of the prototype face during speech. 
We have developed an HMM-based facial
animation algorithm which takes into account both lexical stress and
coarticulation. This algorithm produces realistic animations of the
prototype facial surface from either text or speech. The generic facial motion model is transformed to
a novel face geometry using a set of corresponding points between the generic mesh and the novel face.
In the case of a 2D avatar, a single photograph of the person is used as input. We manually select a small number of features on the photograph and these are used to deform the prototype surface. The deformed surface is then used to animate the photograph. In the case of a 3D avatar, we use a single stereo image of the person as input. The sparse geometry of the face is computed from this image and used to warp the prototype surface to obtain the complete 3D surface of the person&#039;s face. This surface is etched into a glass cube using sub-surface laser engraving (SSLE) technology. Synthesized facial animation videos are then projected onto the etched glass cube. Even though the etched surface is static, the projection of facial animation onto it results in a compelling experience for the viewer. We show several examples of 2D and 3D avatars that are driven by text and speech inputs.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Partial evaluation has been applied to compiler optimization and
generation for decades. Most of the successful partial evaluators have
been designed for general-purpose languages. Our observation is that
domain-specific languages are also suitable targets for partial
evaluation. The unusual computational models in many DSLs bring
challenges as well as optimization opportunities to the compiler.

To enable aggressive optimization, partial evaluation
has to be specialized to fit the specific paradigm of a DSL. In this
dissertation, we present three such specialized partial evaluation
techniques designed for specific languages that address a variety of
compilation concerns. The first algorithm provides a low-cost solution
for simulating concurrency on a single-threaded processor. The second
enables a compiler to compile modest-sized synchronous programs in
pieces that involve communication cycles. The third statically
elaborates recursive function calls that enable programmers to
dynamically create a system&#039;s concurrent components in a convenient
and algorithmic way. Our goal is to demonstrate the potential of
partial evaluation to solve challenging issues in code generation for
domain-specific languages.

Naturally, we do not cover all DSL compilation issues.  We hope our
work will enlighten and encourage future research on the application
of partial evaluation to this area.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The in vivo software testing approach focuses on testing
live applications by executing unit tests throughout the
lifecycle, including after deployment. The motivation is that
the “known state” approach of traditional unit testing is unrealistic;
deployed applications rarely operate under such
conditions, and it may be more informative to perform the
testing in live environments. One of the limitations of this
approach is the high performance cost it incurs, as the unit
tests are executed in parallel with the application. Here we
present distributed in vivo testing, which focuses on easing
the burden by sharing the load across multiple instances of
the application of interest. That is, we elevate the scope
of in vivo testing from a single instance to a community of
instances, all participating in the testing process. Our approach
is different from prior work in that we are actively
testing during execution, as opposed to passively monitoring
the application or conducting tests in the user environment
prior to execution. We discuss new extensions to
the existing in vivo testing framework (called Invite) and
present empirical results that show the performance overhead
improves linearly with the number of clients.</td>

of the Helmholtz equation $-\Delta u+qu=f$ over the unit $d$-cube~$I^d$,
subject to Neumann boundary conditions $\partial_\nu u=g$ on~$\partial
I^d$.  Let $\mathop{\rm card}(\varepsilon,d)$ denote the minimal number of
evaluations of $f$, $g$, and~$q$ needed to compute an absolute or
normalized $\varepsilon$-approximation, assuming that $f$, $g$, and~$q$
vary over balls of weighted reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.  This
problem is said to be weakly tractable if $\mathop{\rm
  card}(\varepsilon,d)$ grows subexponentially in~$\varepsilon^{-1}$ and
$d$.  It is said to be polynomially tractable if $\mathop{\rm
  card}(\varepsilon,d)$ is polynomial in~$\varepsilon^{-1}$ and~$d$, and
strongly polynomially tractable if this polynomial is independent of~$d$.
We have previously studied tractability for the homogeneous version $g=0$
of this problem.  In this paper, we investigate the tractability of the
non-homogeneous problem, with general~$g$.  First, suppose that we use
product weights, in which the role of any variable is moderated by its
particular weight.  We then find that if the weight sum is sublinearly
bounded, then the problem is weakly tractable; moreover, this condition is
more or less necessary.  We then show that the problem is polynomially
tractable if the weight sum is logarithmically or uniformly bounded, and we
estimate the exponents of tractability for these two cases.  Next, we turn
to finite-order weights of fixed order~$\omega$, in which a $d$-variate
function can be decomposed as sum, each term depending on at most
$\omega$~variables.  We show that the problem is always polynomially
tractable for finite-order weights, and we give estimates for the exponents
of tractability.  Since our results so far have established nothing
stronger than polynomial tractability, we look more closely at whether
strong polynomial tractability is possible.  We show that our problem is
never strongly polynomially tractable for the absolute error criterion.
Moreover, we believe that the same is true for the normalized error
criterion, but we have been able to prove this lack of strong tractability
only when certain conditions hold on the weights.  Finally, we use the
Korobov- and min-kernels, along with product weights, to illustrate our
results.</td>

routers and switches.  Implementing packet processors in pipelined
architectures is a well-known, established technique, albeit different
approaches have been proposed.

The design of packet processing pipelines is a delicate trade-off
between the desire for abstract specifications, short development time,
and design maintainability on one hand and very aggressive performance
requirements on the other.

This thesis proposes a coherent design flow for packet processing
pipelines.  Like the design process itself, I start by introducing a
novel domain-specific language that provides a high-level
specification of the pipeline.  Next, I address synthesizing this
model and calculating its worst-case throughput.  Finally, I address
some specific circuit optimization issues.

I claim, based on experimental results, that my proposed technique can
dramatically improve the design process of these pipelines, while the
resulting performance matches the expectations of hand-crafted design.

The considered pipelines exhibit a pseudo-linear topology, which can
be too restrictive in the general case.  However, especially due to
its high performance, such an architecture may be suitable for
applications outside packet processing, in which case some of my
proposed techniques could be easily adapted.

Since I ran my experiments on FPGAs, this work has an inherent bias
towards that technology; however, most results are
technology-independent.</td>

\begin{document}
We continue the study of generalized tractability initiated in our
previous paper ``Generalized tractability for multivariate problems,
Part I: Linear tensor product problems and linear information&#039;&#039;, J.
Complexity, 23, 262-295 (2007).  We study linear tensor product
problems for which we can compute linear information which is given by
arbitrary continuous linear functionals. We want to approximate an
operator $S_d$ given as the $d$-fold tensor product of a compact
linear operator $S_1$ for $d=1,2,\dots\,$, with $\|S_1\|=1$ and $S_1$
has at least two positive singular values.

Let $n(\varepsilon,S_d)$ be the minimal number of information
evaluations needed to approximate $S_d$ to within
$\varepsilon\in[0,1]$. We study \emph{generalized tractability} by
verifying when $n(\varepsilon,S_d)$ can be bounded by a multiple of a
power of $T(\varepsilon^{-1},d)$ for all
$(\varepsilon^{-1},d)\in\Omega \subseteq[1,\infty)\times \mathbb{N}$.  Here,
$T$ is a \emph{tractability} function which is non-decreasing in both
variables and grows slower than exponentially to infinity.  We study
the \emph{exponent of tractability} which is the smallest power of
$T(\varepsilon^{-1},d)$ whose multiple bounds $n(\varepsilon,S_d)$.
We also study \emph{weak tractability}, i.e., when
$\lim_{\varepsilon^{-1}+d\to\infty,(\varepsilon^{-1},d)\in\Omega}
\ln\,n(\varepsilon,S_d)/(\varepsilon^{-1}+d)=0$.
 
In our previous paper, we studied generalized tractability for proper
subsets $\Omega$ of $[1,\infty)\times\mathbb{N}$, whereas in this paper we
take the unrestricted domain $\Omega^{\rm unr}=[1,\infty)\times\mathbb{N}$.

We consider the three cases for which we have only finitely many
positive singular values of $S_1$, or they decay exponentially or
polynomially fast. Weak tractability holds for these three cases, and
for all linear tensor product problems for which the singular values
of $S_1$ decay slightly faster that logarithmically.  We provide
necessary and sufficient conditions on the function~$T$ such that
generalized tractability holds. These conditions are obtained in terms
of the singular values of $S_1$ and mostly limiting properties of $T$.
The tractability conditions tell us how fast $T$ must go to infinity.
It is known that $T$ must go to infinity faster than polynomially. We
show that generalized tractability is obtained for
$T(x,y)=x^{1+\ln\,y}$. We also study tractability functions $T$ of
product form, $T(x,y) =f_1(x)f_2(x)$. Assume that
$a_i=\liminf_{x\to\infty}(\ln\,\ln f_i(x))/(\ln\,\ln\,x)$ is finite
for $i=1,2$.  Then generalized tractability takes place iff
$$a_i&gt;1 \ \ \mbox{and}\ \  (a_1-1)(a_2-1)\ge1,$$
and if $(a_1-1)(a_2-1)=1$ then we need to assume one more condition
given in the paper. If $(a_1-1)(a_2-1)&gt;1$ then the exponent of
tractability is zero, and if $(a_1-1)(a_2-1)=1$ then the exponent of
tractability is finite. It is interesting to add that for $T$ being of
the product form, the tractability conditions as well as the exponent
of tractability depend only on the second singular eigenvalue of $S_1$
and they do \emph{not} depend on the rate of their decay.

Finally, we compare the results obtained in this paper for the
unrestricted domain $\Omega^{\rm unr}$ with the results from our
previous paper obtained for the restricted domain 
$\Omega^{\rm res}=
[1,\infty)\times\{1,2,\dots,d^*\}\,\cup\,[1,\varepsilon_0^{-1})\times\mathbb{N}$
with $d^*\ge1$ and $\varepsilon_0\in(0,1)$. In general, the tractability 
results are quite different. We may have generalized tractability
for the restricted domain and no generalized tractability for the
unrestricted domain which is the case, for instance, 
for polynomial tractability $T(x,y)=xy$. We may also have generalized
tractability for both domains with different or with the same
exponents of tractability.

In this paper, we compare the memory requirements and support counting performance of FP Tree, and Compressed Patricia Trie against several novel variants of vertical bit vectors. First, borrowing ideas from the VLDB domain, we compress vertical bit vectors using WAH encoding. Second, we evaluate the Gray code rank-based transaction reordering scheme, and show that in practice, simple lexicographic ordering, obtained by applying LSB Radix sort, outperforms this scheme.  

Led by these results, we propose HDO, a novel Hamming-distance-based greedy transaction reordering scheme, and aHDO, a linear-time approximation to HDO. We present results of experiments performed on 15 common datasets with varying degrees of sparseness, and show that HDO- reordered, WAH encoded bit vectors can take as little as 5% of the uncompressed space, while aHDO achieves similar compression on sparse datasets. Finally, with results from over a billion database and data mining style frequency query executions, we show that bitmap-based approaches result in up to hundreds of times faster support counting, and HDO-WAH encoded bitmaps offer the best space-time tradeoff.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Software products released into the field typically have some number of residual bugs that either were not detected or could not have been detected during testing. This may be the result of flaws in the test cases themselves, assumptions made during the creation of test cases, or the infeasibility of testing the sheer number of possible configurations for a complex system. Testing approaches such as perpetual testing or continuous testing seek to continue to test these applications even after deployment, in hopes of finding any remaining flaws. In this paper, we present our initial work towards a testing methodology we call “in vivo testing”, in which unit tests are continuously executed inside a running application in the deployment environment. In this novel approach, unit tests execute within the current state of the program (rather than by creating a clean slate) without affecting or altering that state. Our approach has been shown to reveal defects both in the applications of interest and in the unit tests themselves. It can also be used for detecting concurrency or robustness issues that may not have appeared in a testing lab. Here we describe the approach, the testing framework we have developed for Java applications, classes of bugs our approach can discover, and the results of experiments to measure the added overhead.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">There is a considerable body of literature and technology that
provides access control and security of communication for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) based on cryptographic authentication technologies
and protocols. We introduce a new method of granting access and securing communication in a MANET environment to augment, not replace, existing techniques. Previous approaches grant access to the MANET, or to its services, merely by means of an authenticated identity or a qualified role. We present BARTER, a framework that, in addition, requires nodes to exchange a model of their behavior to grant access to the MANET
and to assess the legitimacy of their subsequent communication. This framework forces the nodes not only to say who
or what they are, but also how they behave. BARTER will continuously
run membership acceptance and update protocols to give access to and accept traffic only from nodes whose behavior model is considered ``normal&#039;&#039; according to the behavior model of the nodes in the MANET.
We implement and experimentally evaluate the merger between BARTER and other cryptographic technologies and show that BARTER can implement
a fully distributed automatic access control and update with
small cryptographic costs. Although the methods proposed involve the use of content-based anomaly detection models, the generic infrastructure
implementing the methodology may utilize any behavior model.
Even though the experiments are implemented for MANETs, the idea
of model exchange for access control can be applied to any type of network.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Applying patches, although a disruptive activity, remains a vital part
of software maintenance and defense. When host-based anomaly detection
(AD) sensors monitor an application, patching the application requires
a corresponding update of the sensor&#039;s behavioral model.  Otherwise,
the sensor may incorrectly classify new behavior as malicious (a false
positive) or assert that old, incorrect behavior is normal (a false
negative). Although the problem of ``model drift&#039;&#039; is an almost
universally acknowledged hazard for AD sensors, relatively little work
has been done to understand the process of re-training a ``live&#039;&#039; AD
model --- especially in response to legal behavioral updates like
vendor patches or repairs produced by a self-healing system.

We investigate the feasibility of automatically deriving and applying
a ``model patch&#039;&#039; that describes the changes necessary to update a
``reasonable&#039;&#039; host-based AD behavioral model ({\it i.e.,} a model
whose structure follows the core design principles of existing
host--based anomaly models).  We aim to avoid extensive retraining and
regeneration of the entire AD model when only parts may have changed
--- a task that seems especially undesirable after the exhaustive
testing necessary to deploy a patch.</td>

the encryption keys used to construct the Bloom filters are not
shared with this third party.  Multiple providers and queriers are
supported; provision can be made for third-party ``warrant servers&#039;&#039;,
as well as ``censorship sets&#039;&#039; that limit the data to be shared.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">GloServ is a global service discovery system which
aggregates information about different types of services in a
globally distributed network. GloServ classifies services in an
ontology and maps knowledge obtained by the ontology onto a
scalable hybrid hierarchical peer-to-peer network. The network
mirrors the semantic relationships of service classes and as a
result, reduces the number of message hops across the global
network due to the domain-specific way services are distributed.
Also, since services are described in greater detail, due to
the ontology representation, greater reasoning is applied when
querying and registering services. In this paper, we describe an
enhancement to the GloServ querying mechanism which allows
GloServ servers to process and issue subqueries between servers
of different classes. Thus, information about different service
classes may be queried for in a single query and issued directly
from the front end, creating an extensible platform for service
composition. The results are then aggregated and presented to the
user such that services which share an attribute are categorized
together. We have built and evaluated a location-based web
service discovery prototype which demonstrates the flexibility
of service composition in GloServ and discuss the design and
evaluation of this system. Keywords: service discovery, ontologies,

                    <td class="col-md-2">The problem: Much of finance theory is based on the efficient market hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, the prices of financial assets, such as stocks, incorporate all information that may affect their future performance. However, the translation of publicly
available information into predictions of future performance is far from trivial. Making such predictions is the livelihood of stock traders, market analysts, and the like. Clearly, the efficient market hypothesis is only an approximation which ignores the cost of producing accurate predictions. 

Markets are becoming more efficient and more accessible because of the use of ever faster methods for communicating and analyzing financial data. Algorithms developed in machine learning can be used to automate parts of this translation process. In other words, we can now use machine learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of information and compile them to predict the performance of companies, stocks, or even market analysts. In financial terms, we would say that such algorithms discover inefficiencies in the current market. These discoveries can be used to make a profit and, in turn, reduce the market inefficiencies or support strategic planning processes.

Relevance: Currently, the major stock exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ are transforming their markets into electronic financial markets. Players in these markets must process large amounts of information and make instantaneous investment decisions. 

Machine learning techniques help investors and corporations recognize new business opportunities or potential corporate problems in these markets. With time, these techniques help the financial market become better regulated and more stable. Also, corporations could save significant amount of resources if they can automate certain corporate finance functions such as planning and trading.

Results: This dissertation offers a novel approach to using boosting as a predictive and interpretative tool for problems in finance. Even more, we demonstrate how boosting can support the automation of strategic planning and trading functions. 

Many of the recent bankruptcy scandals in publicly held US companies such as Enron and WorldCom are inextricably linked to the conflict of interest between shareholders (principals) and managers (agents). We evaluate this conflict in the case of Latin American and US companies. In the first part of this dissertation, we use Adaboost to analyze the impact of corporate governance variables on performance. In this respect, we present an algorithm that calculates alternating decision trees (ADTs), ranks variables according to their level of importance, and generates representative ADTs. We develop a board Balanced Scorecard (BSC) based on these representative ADTs which is part of the process to automate the planning functions. 

In the second part of this dissertation we present three main algorithms to improve forecasting and automated trading. First, we introduce a link mining algorithm using a mixture of economic and social network indicators to forecast earnings surprises, and cumulative abnormal return. Second, we propose a trading algorithm for short-term technical trading. The algorithm was tested in the context of the Penn-Lehman Automated Trading Project (PLAT) competition using the Microsoft stock. The algorithm was profitable during the competition. Third, we present a multi-stock automated trading system that includes a machine learning algorithm that makes the prediction, a weighting algorithm that combines the experts, and a risk management layer that selects only the strongest prediction and avoids trading when there is a history of negative performance. This algorithm was tested with 100 randomly selected S&amp;P 500 stocks. We find that even an efficient learning algorithm, such as boosting, still requires powerful control mechanisms in order to reduce unnecessary and unprofitable trades that increase transaction costs.</td>

In this paper we study the private version of the problem, oblivious image matching, and provide an efficient protocol for it.  In doing so, we design a novel image matching algorithm, and a few private protocols that may be of independent interest.  Specifically, we first show how to reduce the image matching problem to a two-level version of the fuzzy set matching problem, and then present a novel protocol to privately compute this (and several other) matching problems.</td>

privacy of online communications, current deployments of
anonymization networks depends on a very small set of nodes that
volunteer their bandwidth. We believe that the main reason is not
disbelief in their ability to protect anonymity, but rather the
practical limitations in bandwidth and latency that stem from
limited participation. This limited participation, in turn, is due
to a lack of incentives. We propose providing economic incentives,
which historically have worked very well.

In this technical report, we demonstrate a payment scheme that can
be used to compensate nodes which provide anonymity in Tor, an
existing onion routing, anonymizing network. We show that current
anonymous payment schemes are not suitable and  introduce a hybrid
payment system based on a combination of the Peppercoin Micropayment

inconspicuous documents can reach third-party applications that may

Such attacks can be very selective and difficult to detect compared to the typical network worm threat, owing to the complexity of these applications and data formats, as well as the multitude of document-exchange vectors. As a case study, this paper focuses on Microsoft Word documents as malcode carriers. We investigate the possibility of detecting embedded malcode in Word documents using two techniques: static content analysis using statistical models of typical document content, and run-time dynamic tests on diverse platforms. The experiments demonstrate these approaches can not only detect known malware, but also most zero-day attacks. We identify several problems with both approaches, representing both challenges in addressing the problem and opportunities for future research.</td>

While much work has focused on the first two, there are very few tools that exist for interpreting the sometimes cryptic messages that result from runtime errors. Novice programmers in particular have difficulty dealing with uncaught exceptions in their code and the resulting stack traces, which are by no means easy to understand. We present Backstop, a tool for debugging runtime errors in Java applications. This tool provides more user-friendly error messages when an uncaught exception occurs, but also provides debugging support by allowing users to watch the execution of the program and the changes to the values of variables. We also present the results of two studies conducted on introductory-level programmers using the two different features of the tool.</td>

We posit, however,that it is possible to realize a self-healing benchmark using a collection of analytical techniques and practical tools as building blocks.

                    <td class="col-md-2">The ability to interactively edit BRDFs in their final placement within a computer graphics scene is vital to making informed choices for material properties. We significantly extend previous work on BRDF editing for static scenes (with fixed lighting and view), by developing a precomputed polynomial representation that enables interactive BRDF editing with global illumination. Unlike previous recomputation based rendering techniques, the image is not linear in the BRDF when considering interreflections. We introduce a framework for precomputing a multi-bounce tensor of polynomial coefficients, that encapsulates the nonlinear nature of the task. Significant reductions in complexity are achieved by leveraging the low-frequency nature of indirect light. We use a high-quality representation for the BRDFs at the first bounce from the eye, and lower-frequency (often diffuse) versions for further bounces. This approximation correctly captures the general global illumination in a scene, including color-bleeding, near-field object reflections, and even caustics. We adapt Monte Carlo path tracing for precomputing the tensor of coefficients for BRDF basis functions. At runtime, the high-dimensional tensors can be reduced to a simple dot product at each pixel for rendering. We present a number of examples of editing BRDFs in complex scenes, with interactive feedback rendered with global illumination.</td>

In the absence of sufficient real-world data, creating suitably large data sets for testing can be a difficult task. Random testing is one solution, but may have limited effectiveness in cases in which a reliable test oracle does not exist, as is the case of the machine learning applications of interest. To address this problem, we have developed an approach to creating data sets called “parameterized random data generation”. Our data generation framework allows us to isolate or combine different equivalence classes as desired, and then randomly generate large data sets using the properties of those equivalence classes as parameters. This allows us to take advantage of randomness but still have control over test case selection at the system testing level. We present our findings from using the approach to test two different machine learning ranking applications.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The efficacy of Anomaly Detection (AD) sensors depends
heavily on the quality of the data used to train them. Arti-
ficial or contrived training data may not provide a realistic
view of the deployment environment. Most realistic data
sets are dirty; that is, they contain a number of attacks
or anomalous events. The size of these high-quality training
data sets makes manual removal or labeling of attack
data infeasible. As a result, sensors trained on this data can
miss attacks and their variations. We propose extending the
training phase of AD sensors (in a manner agnostic to the
underlying AD algorithm) to include a sanitization phase.
This phase generates multiple models conditioned on small
slices of the training data. We use these “micro-models”
to produce provisional labels for each training input, and
we combine the micro-models in a voting scheme to determine
which parts of the training data may represent attacks.
Our results suggest that this phase automatically and significantly
improves the quality of unlabeled training data
by making it as “attack-free” and “regular” as possible in
the absence of absolute ground truth. We also show how a
collaborative approach that combines models from different
networks or domains can further refine the sanitization process
to thwart targeted training or mimicry attacks against
a single site.</td>

distribution model due to its ability to leverage users&#039; upload
bandwidth. However, companies
that sell digital content on-line are hesitant to rely on P2P 
models for paid content distribution due to the free file-sharing
inherent in P2P models. 

In this paper we present Aequitas, a P2P system in which users 
share paid content anonymously via a layer of intermediate nodes.
We argue that with the extra anonymity in Aequitas, vendors
could leverage P2P bandwidth while effectively maintaining
the same level of trust towards their customers as in traditional 
models of paid content distribution. As a result, a 
content provider could reduce its infrastructure costs and 
subsequently lower the costs for the end-users. 

The intermediate nodes are 
incentivized to contribute their bandwidth via electronic micropayments. 
We also introduce techniques that prevent the intermediate nodes
from learning the content of the files they help transmit. 

In this paper we present the design of our system, an analysis of its
properties and an implementation and experimental evaluation.  We
quantify the value of the intermediate nodes, both in terms of
efficiency and their effect on anonoymity.  We argue in support of the
economic and technological merits of the system.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">While peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing is a powerful and cost-effective
content distribution model, most paid-for digital-content providers
(CPs) rely on direct download to deliver their content. CPs such as
Apple iTunes that command a large base of paying users are hesitant to
use a P2P model that could easily degrade their user base into yet
another free file-sharing community.

We present TP2, a system that makes P2P file sharing a viable
delivery mechanism for paid digital content by providing the same
security properties as the currently used direct-download model.}
 introduces the novel notion of trusted auditors (TAs) -- P2P
peers that are controlled by the system operator. TAs monitor the
behavior of other peers and help detect and prevent formation of
illegal file-sharing clusters among the CP&#039;s user base.  TAs both
complement and exploit the strong authentication and authorization
mechanisms that are used in TP2 to control access to content.  It
is important to note that TP2 does not attempt to solve the
out-of-band file-sharing or DRM problems, which also exist in the
direct-download systems currently in use.

We analyze TP2 by modeling it as a novel game between misbehaving
users who try to form unauthorized file-sharing clusters and TAs who
curb the growth of such clusters.  Our analysis shows that a small
fraction of TAs is sufficient to protect the P2P system against
unauthorized file sharing.  In a system with as many as 60\% of
misbehaving users, even a small fraction of TAs can detect 99\% of
unauthorized cluster formation.  We developed a simple economic model
to show that even with such a large fraction of malicious nodes,
TP2 can improve CP&#039;s profits (which could translate to user
savings) by 62 to 122\%, even while assuming conservative estimates of
content and bandwidth costs.  We implemented TP2 as a layer on top
of BitTorrent and demonstrated experimentally using PlanetLab that our
system provides trusted P2P file sharing with negligible performance
overhead.</td>

In this paper, we propose a policy algebra  framework for security policy enforcement in hybrid firewalls, ones that exist both in the network and on end systems. To preserve the security semantics, the policy algebras  provide a formalism to compute addition, conjunction, subtraction, and summation on  rule sets; it also defines the cost and risk functions associated with policy enforcement.  Policy outsourcing triggers global cost minimization. We show that our framework can easily be extended to support packet filter firewall policies. Finally, we discuss special challenges and requirements for applying the policy algebra  framework to MANETs.</td>

of a new and more efficient class of interface circuits to support 
LID. Our design offers substantial improvements in terms of logic 
delay over the design originally proposed by Carloni et al. [1] as 
well as in terms of both logic delay and processing throughput 
over the synchronous elastic architecture (SELF) recently proposed by Cortadella et al. [2]. These claims are supported by the 
experimental results that we obtained completing semi-custom 
implementations of the three designs with a 90nm industrial 
standard-cell library. We also report on the formal verification 
of our design: using the NuSMV model checker we verified that 
the RTL synthesizable implementations of our LID interface 
circuits (relay stations and shells) are correct refinements of the corresponding abstract specifications according to the theory of 
LID [3].</td>

                      Evaluating Software Systems via Fault-Injection and Reliability, Availability and Serviceability (RAS) Metrics and Models

                    <td class="col-md-2">The most common and well-understood way to evaluate and compare computing systems is via performance-oriented benchmarks. However, numerous other demands are placed on computing systems besides speed. Current generation and next generation computing systems are expected
to be reliable, highly available, easy to manage and able to repair faults and recover from failures with minimal human intervention.
The extra-functional requirements concerned with reliability, high availability, and serviceability (manageability, repair and recovery) represent an additional set of high-level goals the system is expected to meet or exceed. These goals govern the system’s operation and are codified using policies and service level agreements (SLAs).
To satisfy these extra-functional requirements, system-designers explore or employ a number of mechanisms geared towards improving the system’s reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) characteristics. However, to evaluate these mechanisms and their impact, we need something more than performance metrics.

Performance-measures are suitable for studying the feasibility of the mechanisms i.e. they can be used to conclude that the level of performance delivered by the system with these mechanisms
active does not preclude its usage. However, performance numbers convey little about the efficacy of the systems RAS-enhancing mechanisms. Further, they do not allow us to analyze the (expected or actual) impact of individual mechanisms or make comparisons/discuss tradeoffs
between mechanisms. 

What is needed is an evaluation methodology that is able to analyze the details of the RAS-enhancing mechanisms – the micro-view as well as the high-level goals, expressed as policies, SLAs etc., governing the system’s operation – the macro-view. Further, we must establish a link
between the details of the mechanisms and their impact on the high-level goals. This thesis is concerned with developing the tools and applying analytical techniques to enable this kind of evaluation. We make three contributions.

First, we contribute to a suite of runtime fault-injection tools with Kheiron. Kheiron demonstrates a feasible, low-overhead, transparent approach to performing system-adaptations in a variety of execution environments at runtime. We use Kheiron’s runtime-adaptation capability to inject faults into running programs. We present three implementations of Kheiron, each targeting a different execution environment. Kheiron/C manipulates compiled C-programs running in an unmanaged execution environment – comprised of the operating system and the underlying
processor. Kheiron/CLR manipulates programs running in Microsoft’s Common Language Runtime (CLR) and Kheiron/JVM manipulates programs running in Sun Microsystems’ Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Kheiron’s operation is transparent to both the application and the execution
environment. Further, the overheads imposed by Kheiron on the application and the execution environment are negligible, &lt;5%, when no faults are being injected.

Second, we describe analytical techniques based on RAS-models, represented as Markov chains and Markov reward models, to demonstrate their power in evaluating RAS-mechanisms and their impact on the high-level goals governing system-operation. We demonstrate the flexibility of these models in evaluating reactive, proactive and preventative mechanisms as well as their ability to explore the feasibility of yet-to-be-implemented mechanisms. Our analytical techniques focus on remediations rather than observed mean time to failures (MTTF). Unlike hardware, where the laws of physics govern the failure rates of mechanical and electrical parts, there
are no such guarantees for software failure rates. Software failure-rates can however be influenced using fault-injection, which we employ in our experiments. In our analysis we consider a number
of facets of remediations, which include, but go beyond mean time to recovery (MTTR). For example we consider remediation success rates, the (expected) impact of preventative-maintenance and the degradation-impact of remediations in our efforts to establish a framework for reasoning
about the tradeoffs (the costs versus the benefits) of various remediation mechanisms.

Finally, we distill our experiences developing runtime fault-injection tools, performing fault-injection experiments and constructing and analyzing RAS-models into a 7-step process for evaluating
computing systems – the 7U-evaluation methodology. Our evaluation method succeeds in establishing the link between the details of the low-level mechanisms and the high-level goals governing the system’s operation. It also highlights the role of environmental constraints and
policies in establishing meaningful criteria for scoring and comparing these systems and their RAS-enhancing mechanisms.</td>

                      Privacy-Preserving Distributed Event Corroboration

                    <td class="col-md-2">Event correlation is a widely-used data processing methodology for a broad variety of applications, and is especially useful in the context of distributed monitoring for software faults and vulnerabilities. However, most existing solutions have typically been focused on &quot;intra-organizational&quot; correlation; organizations typically employ privacy policies that prohibit the exchange of information outside of the organization. At the same time, the promise of &quot;inter-organizational&quot; correlation is significant given the broad availability of Internet-scale communications, and its potential role in both software fault maintenance and software vulnerability detection.

In this thesis, I present a framework for reconciling these opposing forces via the use of privacy preservation integrated into the event processing framework. I introduce the notion of event corroboration, a reduced yet flexible form of correlation that enables collaborative verification, without revealing sensitive information. By accommodating privacy policies, we enable the corroboration of data across different organizations without actually releasing sensitive information. The framework supports both source anonymity and data privacy, yet allows for temporal corroboration of a broad variety of data. The framework is designed as a lightweight collection of components to enable integration with existing COTS platforms and distributed systems. I also present an implementation of this framework: Worminator, a collaborative Intrusion Detection System, based on an earlier platform, XUES (XML Universal Event Service), an event processor used as part of a software monitoring platform called KX (Kinesthetics eXtreme).

KX comprised a series of components, connected together with a publish-subscribe content-based routing event subsystem, for the autonomic software monitoring, reconfiguration, and repair of complex distributed systems. Sensors were installed in legacy systems; XUES&#039; two modules then performed event processing on sensor data: information was collected and processed by the Event Packager, and correlated using the Event Distiller. While XUES itself was not privacy-preserving, it laid the groundwork for this thesis by supporting event typing, the use of publish-subscribe and extensibility support via pluggable event transformation modules. I also describe techniques by which corroboration and privacy preservation could optionally be &quot;retrofitted&quot; onto XUES without breaking the correlation applications and scenarios described.

Worminator is a ground-up rewrite of the XUES platform to fully support privacy-preserving event types and algorithms in the context of a Collaborative Intrusion Detection System (CIDS), whereby sensor alerts can be exchanged and corroborated without revealing sensitive information about a contributor&#039;s network, services, or even external sources, as required by privacy policies. Worminator also fully anonymizes source information, allowing contributors to decide their preferred level of information disclosure. Worminator is implemented as a monitoring framework on top of a collection of non-collaborative COTS and in-house IDS sensors, and demonstrably enables the detection of not only worms but also &quot;broad and stealthy&quot; scans; traditional single-network sensors either bury such scans in large volumes or miss them entirely. Worminator supports corroboration for packet and flow headers (metadata), packet content, and even aggregate models of network traffic using a variety of techniques.

The contributions of this thesis include the development of a cross-application-domain event processing framework with native privacy-preserving types, the use and validation of privacy-preserving corroboration, and the establishment of a practical deployed collaborative security system. The thesis also quantifies Worminator&#039;s effectiveness at attack detection, the overhead of privacy preservation and the effectiveness of our approach against adversaries, be they &quot;honest-but-curious&quot; or actively malicious.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">To proactively defend against intruders from readily jeopardizing single-path data sessions, we propose a {\em distributed secure multipath solution} to route data across multiple paths so that intruders require much more resources to mount successful attacks. Our work exhibits several important properties that include: (1) routing decisions are made locally by network nodes without the centralized information of the entire network topology, (2) routing decisions minimize throughput loss under a single-link attack with respect to
different session models, and (3) routing decisions address multiple link attacks via lexicographic optimization. We devise two algorithms
termed the {\em Bound-Control algorithm} and the {\em Lex-Control algorithm}, both of which provide provably optimal solutions.  Experiments show that the Bound-Control algorithm is more effective to prevent the worst-case single-link attack when compared to the single-path approach, and that the Lex-Control algorithm further enhances the Bound-Control algorithm by countering severe single-link attacks and various types of multi-link attacks. Moreover, the Lex-Control algorithm offers prominent protection after only a few execution rounds, implying that we can sacrifice minimal routing
protection for significantly improved algorithm performance.  Finally, we examine the applicability of our proposed algorithms in a specialized
defensive network architecture called the attack-resistant network and analyze how the algorithms address resiliency and security in different network settings.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Anomaly Detection (AD) sensors have become an invaluable
tool for forensic analysis and intrusion detection.
Unfortunately, the detection performance of all
learning-based ADs depends heavily on the quality of the
training data. In this paper, we extend the training phase
of an AD to include a sanitization phase. This phase significantly
improves the quality of unlabeled training data
by making them as ”attack-free” as possible in the absence
of absolute ground truth. Our approach is agnostic
to the underlying AD, boosting its performance based
solely on training-data sanitization. Our approach is to
generate multiple AD models for content-based AD sensors
trained on small slices of the training data. These
AD “micro-models” are used to test the training data,
producing alerts for each training input. We employ voting
techniques to determine which of these training items
are likely attacks. Our preliminary results show that sanitization
increases 0-day attack detection while in most
cases reducing the false positive rate. We analyze the performance
gains when we deploy sanitized versus unsanitized
AD systems in combination with expensive hostbased
attack-detection systems. Finally, we show that
our system incurs only an initial modest cost, which can
be amortized over time during online operation.</td>

Zeroconf can be used in wireless mobile ad-hoc networks which are based on IEEE 802.11 and IP. However, Zeroconf has problems in mobile ad-hoc networks as it cannot detect changes in the network topology. In highly mobile networks, Zeroconf causes network overhead while discovering new services. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to accelerate service discovery for mobile ad-hoc networks. Our algorithm involves the monitoring of network interface changes that occur when a device with IEEE 802.11 enabled joins a new network area. This algorithm allows users to discover network topology changes and new services in real-time while minimizing network overhead.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Most computer defense systems crash the process that they protect as
part of their response to an attack.  In contrast, self-healing
software recovers from an attack by automatically repairing the
underlying vulnerability. Although recent research explores the
feasibility of the basic concept, self-healing faces four major
obstacles before it can protect legacy applications and COTS
software. Besides the practical issues involved in applying the system
to such software (&lt;i&gt;e.g.&lt;/i&gt;, not modifying source code), self-healing
has encountered a number of problems: knowing when to engage, knowing
how to repair, and handling communication with external entities.
&lt;p&gt;
Our previous work on a self-healing system, STEM, left these
challenges as future work.  STEM provides self-healing by
speculatively executing ``slices&#039;&#039; of a process. This paper improves
STEM&#039;s capabilities along three lines: (1) applicability of the
system to COTS software (STEM does not require source code, and it
imposes a roughly 73% performance penalty on Apache&#039;s normal
operation), (2) semantic correctness of the repair (we introduce
&lt;i&gt;virtual proxies&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;repair policy&lt;/i&gt; to assist the healing
process), and (3) creating a behavior profile based on aspects of
data and control flow.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We consider the problem of optimizing the performance of a latency-insensitive system (LIS) where the addition of backpressure has caused throughput degradation.  Previous works have addressed the problem of LIS performance in different ways.  In particular, the insertion of relay stations and the sizing of the input queues in the shells are the two main optimization techniques that have been proposed.
We provide a unifying framework for this problem by outlining which approaches work for different system topologies, and highlighting counterexamples where some solutions do not work.  We also observe that in the most difficult class of topologies, instances with the greatest throughput degradation are typically very amenable to simplifications. The contributions of this paper include a characterization of topologies that maintain optimal throughput with fixed-size queues and a heuristic for sizing queues that produces solutions close to optimal in a fraction of the time.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">POlymorphic malcode remains one of the most troubling threats for information security and intrusion defense systems. The ability for malcode to be automatically transformed into a semantically equivalent variant frustrates attemtps to construct a single, simple, easily verifiable representation. We present a quantitative analysis of the strentghs and limitations of shellcode polymorphism and consider the impact of this analysis on the current practices in intrusion detection.

Our examination focuses on the nature of shellcode &quot;decoding routines&quot;, and the empirical evidence we gather illustrate our mail result: that the challenge of modeling the class of self-modifying code is  likely intractable - even when the size of the instruction sequence (i.e. the decoder) is relatively small. We develop metrics to gauge the power of polymorphic engines and use them to provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses of some popular engines. We believe this analysis supplies a novel and useful way to understand the limitations of the current generation of signature-based techniques. We analyze some contemporary polymorphic techniques, explore ways to improve them in order to forecast the nature of future threats, and present our suggestions for countermeasures. Our resulsts indicate that the class of polymorphic behavior is too greatly spread and varied to model effectively. We conclude that modeling normal content is ulatimately a more promising defense mechanism than modeling malicious or abnormal content.</td>

architecture used is GloServ. GloServ uses the Web Ontology Language
(OWL) to classify services in an ontology and map knowledge obtained
by the ontology onto a hierarchical peer-to-peer network. Initially,
an ontology-based first order predicate logic query is issued in order
to route the query to the appropriate server and to obtain exact and
related service data.  Text search further enhances querying by
allowing services to be described not only with ontology attributes,
but with plain text so that users can query for them using key
words. Currently, querying is limited to either simple attribute-value
pair searches, ontology queries or text search. Combining ontology
queries with text search enhances current service discovery
mechanisms.</td>

In this project, we built an embedded environment that we intend to
use as a target for the SHIM compiler. We add the uClinux operating
system between hardware devices and software programs.  Our long-term
goal is to have the SHIM compiler generate both user-space and
kernel/module programs for this environment.  This project is a first
step: we manually explored what sort of code we ultimately want the
SHIM compiler to produce.

In this report, we provide instructions on how to build and install
uClinux into an Altera DE2 board and example programs, including a
user-space program, a kernel module, and a simple device driver for
the buttons on the DE2 board that includes an interrupt handler.</td>

This paper describes an implementation of a JPEG decoder in the SHIM
programming language. SHIM is a software/hardware integration language
whose aim is to provide communication between hardware and software
while providing deterministic concurrency.

The paper shows that a JPEG decoder is a good application and
reasonable test case for the SHIM language and illustrates the ease

                    <td class="col-md-2">High dimensionality remains a significant challenge for document clustering. Recent approaches used frequent itemsets and closed frequent itemsets to reduce dimensionality, and to improve the efficiency of hierarchical document clustering. In this paper, we introduce the notion of “closed interesting” itemsets (i.e. closed itemsets with high interestingness). We provide heuristics such as “super item” to efficiently mine these itemsets and show that they provide significant dimensionality reduction over closed frequent itemsets. 

Using “closed interesting” itemsets, we propose a new hierarchical document clustering method that outperforms state of the art agglomerative, partitioning and frequent-itemset based methods both in terms of FScore and Entropy, without requiring dataset specific parameter tuning. We evaluate twenty interestingness measures on nine standard datasets and show that when used to generate “closed interesting” itemsets, and to select parent nodes, Mutual Information, Added Value, Yule’s Q and Chi-Square offers best clustering performance, regardless of the characteristics of underlying dataset. We also show that our method is more scalable, and results in better run-time performance as compare to leading approaches. On a dual processor machine, our method scaled sub-linearly and was able to cluster 200K documents in about 40 seconds.</td>

available bandwidth using single-end controlled TCP packet probes.
To estimate capacity, we generate a train of TCP RST packets “sandwiched” between two TCP SYN packets. Capacity is obtained by
end-to-end packet dispersion of the received TCP RST/ACK packets corresponding to the TCP SYN packets. Our technique is significantly different from the rest of the packet-pair-based measurement techniques, such as CapProbe, pathchar and pathrate, because the long packet trains minimize errors due to bursty cross-traffic. TCP RST packets do not generate additional ICMP replies preventing cross-traffic interference with our probes. In addition, we use TCP packets for all our probes to prevent some types of QoS-related traffic shaping from affecting our measurements. We extend the Train of Packet Pairs technique to approximate the available link capacity. We use pairs of TCP packets with variable intra-pair delays and sizes. This is the first attempt to implement this technique using single-end TCP probes, tested on a wide range of real networks with variable cross-traffic. We compare our prototype with pathchirp and pathload, which require control of both
ends, and demonstrate that in most cases our method gives approximately the same results.</td>

Due to their focus on problem detection, diagnosis and remediation any evaluation methodology should facilitate an objective evaluation and/or comparison of these activities. Measures of “raw” performance are easily quantified and hence facilitate measurement and comparison on the basis of numbers. However, classifying a system better at problem detection, diagnosis and remediation purely on the basis of performance measures is not useful. The proposed evaluation methodology devised will differ from traditional benchmarks, which are primarily concerned with measures of performance. In order to develop this methodology we rely on a set of experiments which will enable us to compare the self-healing capabilities of one system versus another. As currently we do not have available “real” self-healing systems, we will simulate the behavior of some target self-healing systems, system faults and the operational and repair activities of target systems. Further, we will use the results derived from the simulation experiments to answer questions relevant to the utility of a benchmark report.</td>

combines the more cost-effective and scalable distribution capabilities of
P2P systems with a level of trust and control over content
distribution similar to direct download content delivery networks.  \sname\
uses two key mechanisms that can be layered on top of existing P2P
systems.  First, it provides strong authentication to prevent free
file sharing in the system.  Second, it introduces a new notion of trusted
auditors to detect and limit malicious attempts to gain information
about participants in the system to facilitate additional out-of-band
free file sharing.  We analyze \sname\ by modeling it as a novel game
between malicious users who try to form free file sharing clusters
and trusted auditors who curb the growth of such clusters.  Our analysis
shows that a small fraction of trusted auditors
is sufficient to protect the P2P system against unauthorized file
sharing.  Using a simple economic model, we further show that
\sname\ provides a more cost-effective content distribution solution,
resulting in higher profits for a content provider even in the
presence of a large percentage of malicious users.  Finally, we

                    <td class="col-md-2">With the growth of presence-based services, it is important to provision the network to support high traffic and load generated by presence services. Presence event distribution systems amplify a single incoming PUBLISH message into possibly numerous outgoing NOTIFY messages from the server. This can increase the network load on inter-domain links and can potentially disrupt other QoS-sensitive applications. In this document, we present existing as well as new techniques that can be used to reduce presence traffic both in inter-domain and intra-domain scenarios. Specifically, we propose two new techniques: sending common NOTIFY for multiple watchers and batched notifications. We also propose some generic heuristics that can be used to reduce network traffic due to presence.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">ENUM is a protocol standard developed by the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) for translating the E.164 phone numbers into Internet
Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs). It plays an increasingly
important role as the bridge between Internet and traditional
telecommunications services. ENUM is based on the Domain Name System
(DNS), but places unique performance requirements on DNS server. In
particular, ENUM server needs to host a huge number of records,
provide high query throughput for both existing and non-existing
records in the server, maintain high query performance under update
load, and answer queries within a tight latency budget. In this
report, we evaluate and compare performance of serving ENUM queries by
three servers, namely BIND, PDNS and Navitas. Our objective is to
answer whether and how these servers can meet the unique performance
requirements of ENUM.  Test results show that the ENUM query response
time on our platform has always been on the order of a few
milliseconds or less, so this is likely not a concern. Throughput then
becomes the key.  The throughput of BIND degrades linearly as the
record set size grows, so BIND is not suitable for ENUM. PDNS delivers
higher performance than BIND in most cases, while the commercial
Navitas server presents even better ENUM performance than PDNS. Under
our 5M-record set test, Navitas server with its default configuration
consumes one tenth to one sixth the memory of PDNS, achieves six times
higher throughput for existing records and an order of two magnitudes
higher throughput for non-existing records than the bottom line PDNS
server without caching.  The throughput of Navitas is also the highest
among the tested servers when the database is being updated in the
background. We investigated ways to improve PDNS performance. For
example, doubling CPU processing power by putting PDNS and its backend
database in two separate machines can increase PDNS throughput for
existing records by 45% and that for nonexisting records by 40%. Since
PDNS is open source, we also instrumented the source code to obtain a
detailed profile of contributions of various systems components to the
overall latency.  We found that when the server is within its normal
load range, the main component of server processing latency is caused
by backend database lookup operations.  Excessive number of backend
database lookups is the reason that makes PDNS throughput for
non-existing records its key weakness. We studied using PDNS caching
to reduce the number of database lookups. With a full packet cache and
a modified cache maintenance mechanism, the PDNS throughput for
existing records can be improved by 100%. This brings the value to one
third of its Navitas counterpart. After enabling the PDNS negative
query cache, we improved PDNS throughput for non-existing records to
the level comparable to its throughput for existing records, but this
result is still an order of magnitude lower than the corresponding
value in Navitas. Further improvements of PDNS throughput for
non-existing records will require optimization of related processing
mechanism in its implementation.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We address the problem of specifying concurrent processes that can make local
nondeterministic decisions without affecting global system
behavior---the sequence of events communicated along each
inter-process communication channel.  Such nondeterminism can be used
to cope with unpredictable execution rates and communication delays.

Our model
resembles Kahn&#039;s, but does not include unbounded buffered
communication, so it is much simpler to reason about and implement.
After formally characterizing these so-called confluent processes, we
propose a collection of operators, including sequencing, parallel, and
our own creation, confluent choice, that guarantee confluence by
construction.

The result is a set of primitive constructs that form the formal basis
of a concurrent programming language for both hardware and software
systems that gives deterministic behavior regardless of the relative
execution rates of the processes.  Such a language greatly simplifies
the verification task because any correct implementation of such a
system is guaranteed to have the same behavior, a property rarely
found in concurrent programming environments.</td>

computation.  That programmers must worry about races and other

has not been widely adopted.  The SHIM concurrent language,
intended for hardware/software codesign applications, avoids this
problem by providing deterministic (race-free) concurrency, but does
not support automatic parallelization of sequential algorithms.

In this paper, we present a compiler able to parallelize a simple
MATLAB-like language into concurrent SHIM processes.  From a
user-provided partitioning of arrays to processes, our compiler
divides the program into coarse-grained processes and schedules and
synthesizes inter-process communication.  We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on some image-processing algorithms.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Concurrent programming languages should be a good fit for embedded
systems because they match the intrinsic parallelism of their
architectures and environments.  Unfortunately, most concurrent
programming formalisms are prone to races and nondeterminism, despite
the presence of mechanisms such as monitors.

In this paper, we propose SHIM, the core of a concurrent language with
disciplined shared variables that remains deterministic, meaning the
behavior of a program is independent of the scheduling of concurrent
operations. SHIM does not sacrifice power or flexibility to achieve
this determinism. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous
paradigms---loosely and tightly synchronized threads---the dynamic
creation of threads and shared variables, recursive procedures, and
exceptions.

We illustrate our programming model with examples including
breadth-first-search algorithms and pipelines. By construction, they
are race-free. We provide the formal semantics of SHIM and a
preliminary implementation.</td>

We also specify general debugging criteria that we feel all AOP systems should support.

We present a novel solution to the problem of debugging aspect-enabled programs.  Our Wicca system is the first dynamic AOP system to support full source-level debugging of woven code.  It introduces a new weaving strategy that combines source weaving with online byte-code patching.  Changes to the aspect rules, or base or aspect source code are rewoven and recompiled on-the-fly.  We present the results of an experiment that show how these features provide the programmer with a powerful interactive debugging experience with relatively little overhead.</td>

tractability and strong tractability for quasilinear multivariate
problems in the worst case setting.  One important example of such a
problem is the solution of the heat equation $u_t = \Delta u - qu$ in
$I^d\times(0,T)$, where $I$ is the unit interval and $T$ is a maximum
time value.  This problem is to be solved subject to homogeneous
Dirichlet boundary conditions, along with the initial conditions
$u(\cdot,0)=f$ over~$I^d$.  The solution~$u$ depends linearly on~$f$,
but nonlinearly on~$q$.  Here, both $f$ and~$q$ are $d$-variate
functions from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with finite-order
weights of order~$\omega$.  This means that, although~$d$ can be
arbitrary large, $f$ and~$q$ can be decomposed as sums of functions of
at most $\omega$~variables, with $\omega$ independent of~$d$.

In this paper, we apply our previous general results to the heat
equation.  We study both the absolute and normalized error criteria.
For either error criterion, we show that the problem is \emph.  That
is, the number of evaluations of $f$ and~$q$ needed to obtain an
$\varepsilon$-approximation is polynomial in~$\varepsilon$ and~$d$,
with the degree of the polynomial depending linearly on~$\omega$.  In
addition, we want to know when the problem is \emph{strongly
tractable}, meaning that the dependence is polynomial only
in~$\varepsilon$, independently of~$d$.  We show that if the sum of
the weights defining the weighted reproducing kernel Hilbert space is
uniformly bounded in~$d$ and the integral of the univariate kernel is
positive, then the heat equation is strongly tractable.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">In this paper, we present a new class of volumetric displays that can
be used to display 3D objects. The basic approach is to trade-off the
spatial resolution of a digital projector (or any light engine) to gain
resolution in the third dimension. Rather than projecting an image
onto a 2D screen, a depth-coded image is projected onto a 3D cloud
of passive optical scatterers. The 3D point cloud is realized using a
technique called Laser Induced Damage (LID), where each scatterer
is a physical crack embedded in a block of glass or plastic. We show
that when the point cloud is randomized in a specific manner, a very
large fraction of the points are visible to the viewer irrespective of
his/her viewing direction. We have developed an orthographic projection
system that serves as the light engine for our volumetric displays.
We have implemented several types of point clouds, each one
designed to display a specific class of objects. These include a cloud
with uniquely indexable points for the display of true 3D objects, a
cloud with an independently indexable top layer and a dense extrusion
volume to display extruded objects with arbitrarily textured top
planes and a dense cloud for the display of purely extruded objects.
In addition, we show how our approach can be used to extend simple
video games to 3D. Finally, we have developed a 3D avatar in which
videos of a face with expression changes are projected onto a static
surface point cloud of the face.</td>

consider a language that allows comparison and a limited form of

to complete the partial order terminates.  We consider various ways of
composing partial orders from smaller pieces, and provide results on
the size of the resulting transitive closures.  We introduce the

                    <td class="col-md-2">VoIP (Voice over IP) services are using the Internet infrastructure to
enable new forms of communication and collaboration.  A growing number
of VoIP service providers such as Skype, Vonage, Broadvoice, as well
as many cable services are using the Internet to offer telephone
services at much lower costs.  However, VoIP services rely on the
user&#039;s Internet connection, and this can often translate into lower
quality communication.  Overlay networks offer a potential solution to
this problem by improving the default Internet routing and overcome
failures.

To assess the feasibility of using overlays to improve VoIP
on the Internet, we have conducted a detailed experimental study to
evaluate the benefits of using an overlay on PlanetLab nodes for
improving voice communication connectivity and performance around the
world.  Our measurements demonstrate that an overlay architecture
can significantly improve VoIP communication across most regions
and provide their greatest benefit for locations with poorer default
Internet connectivity.  We explore overlay topologies and show that a
small number of well-connected intermediate nodes is sufficient to
improve VoIP performance.  We show that there is significant
variation over time in the best overlay routing paths and argue for
the need for adaptive routing to account for this variation to deliver
the best performance.</td>

nation, materials and shadows with real-time interactivity. These methods separate the
scene’s static and dynamic components allowing the static portion to be computed as a
preprocess. In this work, we hold geometry static and allow either the lighting or BRDF
to be dynamic. To achieve real-time performance, both static and dynamic components
are compressed by exploiting spatial and angular coherence. Temporal coherence of the
dynamic component from frame to frame is an important, but unexplored additional form
of coherence. In this thesis, we explore temporal coherence of two forms of all-frequency
PRT: BRDF material editing and lighting design. We develop incremental methods for
approximating the differences in the dynamic component between consecutive frames. For
BRDF editing, we find that a pure incremental approach allows quick convergence to an
exact solution with smooth real-time response.
For relighting, we observe vastly differing degrees of temporal coherence accross levels of
the lighting’s wavelet hierarchy. To address this, we develop an algorithm that treats each
level separately, adapting to available coherence. The proposed methods are othogonal to
other forms of coherence, and can be added to almost any PRT algorithm with minimal
implementation, computation, or memory overhead. We demonstrate our technique within
existing codes for nonlinear wavelet approximation, changing view with BRDF factorization,
and clustered PCA. Exploiting temporal coherence of dynamic lighting yields a 3×–4× per-
formance improvement, e.g., all-frequency effects are achieved with 30 wavelet coefficients,
about the same as low-frequency spherical harmonic methods. Distinctly, our algorithm
smoothly converges to the exact result within a few frames of the lighting becoming static.</td>

monitoring mechanisms that are completely external lose the advantage

speculatively executing &quot;slices&quot; of an application. VxF introduces

Packet payload sharing techniques hold far more promise, as they can convey exploit vectors and/or malcode used upon successful exploit of a target system, irrespective of obfuscated source addresses.  However, payload sharing has had minimal success due to regulatory or business-based privacy concerns of transmitting raw or even sanitized payloads. The currently accepted form of content exchange has been limited to the exchange of known-suspicious content, e.g., packets captured by honeypots; however, signature generation assumes that each site receives enough traffic in order to correlate a meaningful set of payloads from which common content can be derived, and places fundamental and computationally stressful requirements on signature generators that may miss particularly stealthy or carefully-crafted polymorphic malcode.

Instead, we propose a new approach to enable the sharing of suspicious payloads via privacy-preserving technologies. We detail the work we have done with two example payload anomaly detectors, PAYL and Anagram, to support generalized payload correlation and signature generation without releasing identifiable payload data and without relying on single-site signature generation. We present preliminary results of our approaches and suggest how such deployments may practically be used for not only cross-site, but also cross-domain alert sharing and its implications for profiling threats.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The shading in a scene depends on a combination of
many factors---how the lighting varies spatially across a surface, how
it varies along different directions, the geometric curvature and
reflectance properties of objects, and the locations of soft shadows.
In this paper, we conduct a complete first order or gradient analysis of
lighting, shading and shadows, showing how each factor separately
contributes to scene appearance, and when it is important.  Gradients
are well suited for analyzing the intricate combination of appearance
effects, since each gradient term corresponds directly to variation in
a specific factor.  First, we show how the spatial {\em and}
directional gradients of the light field change, as light interacts
with curved objects.  This extends the recent frequency analysis of
Durand et al.\ to gradients, and has many advantages for operations,
like bump-mapping, that are difficult to analyze in the
Fourier domain.  Second, we consider the individual terms responsible
for shading gradients, such as lighting variation, convolution with
the surface BRDF, and the object&#039;s curvature.  This analysis indicates
the relative importance of various terms, and shows precisely how they
combine in shading.  As one practical application, our theoretical
framework can be used to adaptively sample images in high-gradient
regions for efficient rendering.  Third, we understand the effects of
soft shadows, computing accurate visibility gradients.  We generalize
previous work to arbitrary curved occluders, and develop a 
local framework that is easy to integrate with conventional
ray-tracing methods.  Our visibility gradients can be directly used in
practical gradient interpolation methods for efficient rendering.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The increasing sophistication of software attacks has created the need
for increasingly finer-grained intrusion and anomaly detection
systems, both at the network and the host level. We believe that the
next generation of defense mechanisms will require a much more
detailed dynamic analysis of application behavior than is currently
done.  We also note that the same type of behavior analysis is needed
by the current embryonic attempts at self-healing systems. Because
such mechanisms are currently perceived as too expensive in terms of
their performance impact, questions relating to the feasibility and
value of such analysis remain unexplored and unanswered.

We present a new mechanism for profiling the behavior space of an
application by analyzing all function calls made by the process,
including regular functions and library calls, as well as system
calls. We derive behavior from aspects of both control and data flow.
We show how to build and check profiles that contain this information
at the binary level -- that is, without making changes to the
application&#039;s source, the operating system, or the compiler. This
capability makes our system, Lugrind, applicable to a variety of
software, including COTS applications. Profiles built for the
applications we tested can predict behavior with 97% accuracy given a
context window of 15 functions. Lugrind demonstrates the
feasibility of combining binary-level behavior profiling with
detection and automated repair.</td>

models a mixture of high-order n-grams (n &gt; 1) designed to detect  
anomalous and ^Ósuspicious^Ô network packet payloads. By using higher- 
order n-grams, Anagram can detect significant anomalous byte  
sequences and generate robust signatures of validated malicious  
packet content. The Anagram content models are implemented using  
highly efficient Bloom filters, reducing space requirements and  
enabling privacy-preserving cross-site correlation. The sensor models  
the distinct content flow of a network or host using a semi- 
supervised training regimen. Previously known exploits, extracted  
from the signatures of an IDS, are likewise modeled in a Bloom filter  
and are used during training as well as detection time. We demon- 
strate that Anagram can identify anomalous traffic with high accuracy  
and low false positive rates. Anagram^Òs high-order n-gram analysis  
technique is also resil-ient against simple mimicry attacks that  
blend exploits with ^Ónormal^Ô appearing byte padding, such as the  
blended polymorphic attack recently demonstrated in [1]. We discuss  
randomized n-gram models, which further raises the bar and makes it  
more difficult for attackers to build precise packet structures to  
evade Anagram even if they know the distribution of the local site  
content flow. Finally, Ana-gram^Òs speed and high detection rate makes  
it valuable not only as a standalone sensor, but also as a network  
anomaly flow classifier in an instrumented fault-tolerant host-based  
environment; this enables significant cost amortization and the  
possibility of a ^Ósymbiotic^Ô feedback loop that can improve accuracy  
and reduce false positive rates over time.</td>

Intrusion Prevention and Self-Healing Software.  Unfortunately, such
systems find it difficult to gain traction in many deployment
scenarios.  For self-healing techniques to be realistically employed,
system owners and administrators must have enough confidence in the
quality of a generated fix that they are willing to allow its
automatic deployment. 

In order to increase the level of confidence in these systems, the efficacy of a &#039;fix&#039; must be tested and validated after it
has been automatically developed, but before it is actually
deployed. Due to the nature of attacks, such verification must proceed
automatically.  We call this problem Automatic Repair Validation
(ARV). As a way to illustrate the difficulties faced by ARV, we
propose the design of a system, Bloodhound, that tracks and
stores malicious network flows for later replay in the validation
phase for self-healing software.</td>

distance case, the global rigidity of the formation is simpler (in

it has the potential to lay the mathematical foundations for two important practical applications.

compare results with DUC 2005, and to provide an independent test

DUC 2003 and 2005 datasets pertain to the document length, cluster
sizes, and model summary length. For five of the DUC 2003 document sets,
two pyramids each were
constructed by annotators working independently. Scores of the same
peer using different pyramids were highly correlated. Sixteen systems
were evaluated on eight document sets.
Analysis of variance using Tukey&#039;s Honest Significant Difference
method showed significant differences among all eight document sets,
and more significant differences among the sixteen systems than for DUC 2005.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">This paper is concerned with information structures used in rigid
formations of autonomous agents that have leader-follower
architecture. The focus of the paper is on sensor/network
topologies to secure control of rigidity. This papers extends the
previous rigidity based approaches for formations with symmetric
neighbor relations to include formations with leader-follower
architecture. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for
rigidity of directed formations, with or without cycles. We
present the directed Henneberg constructions as a sequential
process for all guide rigid digraphs. We refine those results for
acyclic formations, where guide rigid formations had a simple
construction. The analysis in this paper confirms that acyclicity
is not a necessary condition for stable rigidity. The cycles are
not the real problem, but rather the lack of guide freedom is the
reason behind why cycles have been seen as a problematic topology.
Topologies that have cycles within a larger architecture can be
stably rigid, and we conjecture that all guide rigid formations
are stably rigid for internal control. We analyze how the external
control of guide agents can be integrated into stable rigidity of
a larger formation. The analysis in the paper also confirms the
inconsistencies that result from noisy measurements in redundantly
rigid formations. An algorithm given in the paper establishes a
sequential way of determining the directions of links from a given
undirected rigid formation so that the necessary and sufficient
conditions are fulfilled.</td>

A critical issue in designing a NOC is to determine its topology given the set of point-to-point communication requirements among these
components. We present a novel approach to on-chip communication synthesis that is based on the iterative combination of two efficient computational steps: (1) an application of the k-Median algorithm to coarsely determine the global communication structure (which may turned out not be a network after all), and a (2) a variation of the shortest-path algorithm in order to finely tune the data flows on the communication channels. The application of our method to case
studies taken from the literature shows that we can automatically synthesize optimal NOC topologies for multi-core on-chip processors and it offers new insights on why NOC are not necessarily a value proposition for some classes of applcation-specific SOCs.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Routing protocols rely on the cooperation of nodes in the network to
both forward packets and to select the forwarding routes.
There have been several instances in which an entire
network&#039;s routing collapsed simply because a seemingly insignificant
set of nodes reported erroneous routing information to their
neighbors. It may have been possible for other nodes to trigger an automated response
and prevent the problem by analyzing received routing information for
inconsistencies that revealed the errors. Our theoretical study seeks to
understand when nodes can detect the existence of errors in the
implementation of route
selection elsewhere in the network through monitoring their own
routing states for inconsistencies. We start by constructing a
methodology, called Strong-Detection, that helps answer the
question. We then apply Strong-Detection to three classes of routing
protocols: distance-vector, path-vector, and link-state.  For each
class, we derive low-complexity, self-monitoring algorithms that use
the routing state created by these routing protocols to identify any
detectable anomalies. These algorithms are then used
to compare and contrast the self-monitoring power these various
classes of protocols possess. We also study the trade-off between
their state-information complexity and ability to identify routing anomalies.</td>

Hence, presence systems need to be appropriately dimensioned to meet the growing number of users, varying number of devices as presence sources, the rate at which they update presence information to the network and the rate at which network distributes the user’s presence information to the watchers. SIMPLEstone is a set of metrics for benchmarking the performance of presence systems based on SIMPLE. SIMPLEstone benchmarks a presence server by generating requests based on a work load specification. It measures server capacity in terms of request handling capacity as an aggregate of all types of requests as well as individual request types. The benchmark treats different configuration modes in which presence server interoperates with the Session Initiation protocol (SIP) server as one block.</td>

GDQ achieves accurate proportional fairness scheduling with only O(1) scheduling overhead.

GDQ takes a novel approach to distributed queuing: instead of creating per-processor queues that need to be constantly balanced to achieve any measure of proportional sharing fairness, GDQ uses a simple grouping strategy to organize processes into groups based on similar processor time allocation rights, and then assigns processors to groups based on aggregate group shares. Group membership of processes is static, and fairness is achieved by dynamically migrating processors among groups. The set of processors working on a group use simple, low-overhead round-robin queues, while processor reallocation among groups is achieved using a new multiprocessor adaptation of the well-known Weighted Fair Queuing algorithm. By commoditizing processors and decoupling their allocation from process scheduling, GDQ provides, with only constant scheduling cost, fairness within a constant of the ideal generalized processor sharing model for process weights with a fixed upper bound.

We have implemented GDQ in Linux and measured its performance. Our experimental results show that GDQ has low overhead and scales well with the number of processors.</td>

layer cryptographic operations (SSL/TLS), there are many

becomes increasingly important in these trust models to protect
the confidentiality and integrity of the data against snooping
and modification by the communications provider.

We introduce W3Bcrypt, an extension to the Mozilla Firefox web
platform that enables application-level cryptographic protection
for web content. In effect, we view cryptographic operations as
a type of style to be applied to web content along with layout
and coloring operations. Among the main benefits of using
encryption as a stylesheet are $(a)$ reduced workload on a web
server, $(b)$ targeted content publication, and $(c)$ greatly
increased privacy. This paper discusses our implementation for
Firefox, but the core ideas are applicable to most current

reactive, proactive or preventative action as a result of
changes in its environment has added the non-functional
requirement of adaptation to the list of facilities expected
in self-managing systems. The adaptations we are concerned
with assist with problem detection, diagnosis and
remediation. Many existing computing systems do not include
such adaptation mechanisms, as a result these systems
either need to be re-designed to include them or there
needs to be a mechanism for retro-fitting these mechanisms.
The purpose of the adaptation mechanisms is to ease the
job of the system administrator with respect to managing
software systems. This paper introduces Kheiron, a framework
for facilitating adaptations in running programs in a
variety of execution environments without requiring the redesign
of the application. Kheiron manipulates compiled
C programs running in an unmanaged execution environment
as well as programs running in Microsoft’s Common
Language Runtime and SunMicrosystems’ Java VirtualMachine.
We present case-studies and experiments that demonstrate
the feasibility of using Kheiron to support self-healing
systems. We also describe the concepts and techniques used
to retro-fit adaptations onto existing systems in the various
execution environments.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Most current approaches to self-healing software (SHS) suffer
from semantic incorrectness of the response mechanism. To
support SHS, we propose Smart Error Virtualization (SEV),
which treats functions as transactions but provides a way to
guide the program state and remediation to be a more correct
value than previous work.

We perform runtime binary-level profiling on unmodified 
applications to learn both good return values and error return 
values (produced when the program encounters ``bad&#039;&#039; input). 
The goal is to ``learn from mistakes&#039;&#039; by converting malicious 
input to the program&#039;s notion of ``bad&#039;&#039; input.

We introduce two implementations of this system that support
three major uses: function profiling for regression testing, 
function profiling for host-based anomaly detection 
(envinroment-specialized fault detection), and function profiling
for automatic attack remediation via SEV. Our systems do not
require access to the source code of the application to enact
a fix. Finally, this paper is, in part, a critical examination of 
error virtualization in order to shed light on how to approach
semantic correctness.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We study the complexity of approximating the smallest eigenvalue of a univariate Sturm-Liouville problem on a quantum computer. This general problem includes the special case of solving a one-dimensional Schroedinger equation with a given potential for the ground state energy. 
The Sturm-Liouville problem depends on a function q, which, in the case of the Schroedinger equation, can be identified with the potential function V. Recently Papageorgiou and Wozniakowski proved that quantum computers achieve an exponential reduction in the number of queries over the number needed in the classical worst-case and randomized settings for smooth functions q. Their method uses the (discretized) unitary propagator and arbitrary powers of it as a query (&quot;power queries&quot;). They showed that the Sturm-Liouville equation can be solved with O(log(1/e)) power queries, while the number of queries in the worst-case and randomized settings on a classical computer is polynomial in 1/e. This proves that a quantum computer with power queries achieves an exponential reduction in the number of queries compared to a classical computer. 
In this paper we show that the number of queries in Papageorgiou&#039;s and Wozniakowski&#039;s algorithm is asymptotically optimal. In particular we prove a matching lower bound of log(1/e) power queries, therefore showing that log(1/e) power queries are sufficient and necessary. Our proof is based on a frequency analysis technique, which examines the probability distribution of the final state of a quantum algorithm and the dependence of its Fourier transform on the input.</td>

adjustment of timer values for event correlation rules, in particular compensating for the variability of event propagation
delays due to factors such as contention for network and server resources. We describe a corresponding Management Station

                    <td class="col-md-2">Large organizations are deploying ever-increasing numbers of networked compute devices, from utilities installing smart controllers on electricity distribution cables, to the military giving PDAs to soldiers, to corporations putting PCs on the desks of employees.  These computers are often far more capable than is needed to accomplish their primary task, whether it be guarding a circuit breaker, displaying a map, or running a word processor.  These devices would be far more useful if they had some awareness of the world around them: a controller that resists tripping a switch, knowing that it would set off a cascade failure, a PDA that warns its owner of imminent danger, a PC that exchanges reports of suspicious network activity to its peers to identify stealthy computer crackers.  

In order to provide these higher-level services, the devices need a model of their environment.  The controller needs a model of the distribution grid, the PDA needs a model of the battlespace, and the PC needs a model of the network and of normal network and user behavior. Unfortunately, not only might models such as these require substantial computational resources, but generating and updating them is even more demanding. Modelbuilding algorithms tend to be bad in three ways: requiring large amounts of CPU and memory to run, needing large amounts of data from the outside to stay up to date, and running so slowly that can’t keep up with any fast changes in the environment that might occur.  

We can solve these problems by reducing the scope of the model to the immediate locale of the device, since reducing the size of the model makes the problem of model generation much more tractable. But such models are also much less useful, having no knowledge of the wider system.  

This thesis proposes a better solution to this problem called Level of Detail, after the computer graphics technique of the same name. Instead of simplifying the representation of distant objects, however, we simplify less-important data. Compute devices in the system receive streams of data that is a mixture of detailed data from devices that directly affect them and data summaries (aggregated data) from less directly influential devices. The degree to which the data is aggregated (i.e., how much it is reduced) is determined by calculating an influence metric between the target device and the remote device. The smart controller thus receives a continuous stream of raw data from the adjacent transformer, but only an occasional small status report summarizing all the equipment in a neighborhood in another part of the city.  

This thesis describes the data distribution system, the aggregation functions, and the influence metrics that can be used to implement such a system. I also describe my current towards establishing a test environment and validating the concepts, and describe the next steps in the research plan.</td>

unspecified, tree structure and exploit this assumption in learning
problems. Such a tree structure assumption is equivalent to treating a
dataset as being tree dependent identically distributed or tdid and
preserves exchange-ability. This extends traditional iid assumptions
on data since each datum can be sampled sequentially after being
conditioned on a parent. Instead of hypothesizing a single best tree
structure, we infer a richer Bayesian posterior distribution over tree
structures from a given dataset. We compute this posterior over
(directed or undirected) trees via the Laplacian of conditional
distributions between pairs of input data points. This posterior
distribution is efficiently normalized by the Laplacian&#039;s
determinant and also facilitates novel maximum likelihood estimators,
efficient expectations and other useful inference computations. In a
classification setting, tdid assumptions yield a criterion that
maximizes the determinant of a matrix of conditional distributions
between pairs of input and output points. This leads to a novel
classification algorithm we call the Maximum Determinant
Machine. Unsupervised and supervised experiments are shown.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Software faults and vulnerabilities continue to present significant 
obstacles to achieving reliable and secure software. The critical
problem is that systems currently lack the capability to respond 
intelligently and automatically to attacks -- especially attacks 
that exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities or are delivered by
previously unseen inputs. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to 
provide an environment where both supervision and automatic 
remediation can take place. Also provided is a mechanism to guide 
the supervision environment in detection and repair activities.

This thesis supports the notion of Self-Healing Software by
introducing three novel techniques: \emph{micro-sandboxing}, 
\emph{micro-speculation}, and \emph{self-correcting assertions}. These
techniques are combined in a kernel-level emulation framework to 
speculatively execute code that may contain faults or 
vulnerabilities and automatically repair such faults or exploited 
vulnerabilities. The framework, VPUF, introduces the concept of
computation as an operating system service by providing control
for an array of virtual processors in the Linux kernel (creating
the concept of an \emph{endolithic} kernel). This thesis introduces
ROAR (Recognize, Orient, Adapt, Respond) as a conceptual
workflow for Self-healing Software systems.

This thesis proposal outlines a 17 month program for developing the 
major components of the proposed system, implementing them on a 
COTS operating system and programming language, subjecting them to 
a battery of evaluations for performance and efficacy, and publishing 
the results. In addition, this proposal looks forward to several 
areas of follow-on work, including implementing some of the proposed 
techniques in hardware and leveraging the general kernel-level 
framework to support Application Communities.</td>

systems self-managing. This paper explores the extent to which control
theory can provide an architectural and analytic foundation for
building self-managing systems. Control theory provides a rich set of
methodologies for building automated self-diagnosis and self-repairing
systems with properties such as stability, short settling times, and
accurate regulation. However, there are challenges in applying control
theory to computing systems, such as developing effective resource
models, handling sensor delays, and addressing lead times in effector
actions. We propose a deployable testbed for autonomic computing
(DTAC) that we believe will reduce the barriers to addressing research
problems in applying control theory to computing systems. The initial
DTAC architecture is described along with several problems that it can
be used to investigate.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Routing protocols in most ad hoc networks use the length of paths as the routing metric. Recent findings have revealed that the minimum-hop metric can not achieve the maximum throughput because it tries to reduce the number of hops by containing long range links, where packets need to be transmitted at the lowest transmission rate. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoff between transmission rates and throughputs and show that in dense networks with uniform-distributed traffic, there exists the optimal rate that may not be the lowest rate. Based on our observation, we propose a new routing metric, which measures the expected capability of a path assuming the per-node fairness. We develop a routing protocol based on DSDV and demonstrate that the routing metric enhances the system throughput by 20% compared to the original DSDV.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Managed execution environments such as Microsoft’s Common Language Runtime (CLR) and Sun Microsystems’ Java Virtual Machine (JVM) provide a number of services – including but not limited to application isolation, security sandboxing, garbage collection and structured exception handling – that are aimed primarily at enhancing the robustness of managed applications. However, none of these services directly enables performing reconfigurations, repairs or diagnostics on the managed
applications and/or its constituent subsystems and components.
In this paper we examine how the facilities of a managed execution environment can be leveraged to support runtime system adaptations, such as reconfigurations and repairs. We describe an adaptation framework we have developed, which uses these facilities to dynamically attach/detach an engine capable of performing reconfigurations and repairs on a target system while it executes. Our adaptation framework is lightweight, and transparent to the application and the managed execution environment: it does not require recompilation of the application nor specially compiled
versions of the managed execution runtime. Our prototype was implemented for the CLR. To evaluate our framework beyond toy examples, we searched on SourceForge for potential target systems already implemented on the CLR that might benefit from runtime adaptation. We report on our experience using our prototype to effect runtime reconfigurations in a system that was developed and is in use by others: the Alchemi enterprise Grid Computing System developed at the University of Melbourne, Australia.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The increasing popularity of online courses has highlighted the need for collaborative learning tools for student groups. In addition, the introduction of lecture videos into the online curriculum has drawn attention to the disparity in the network resources available to students. We present an e-Learning architecture and adaptation model called AI2TV (Adaptive Interactive Internet Team Video), which allows groups of students to collaboratively view a video in synchrony. AI2TV upholds the invariant that each student will view semantically equivalent content at all times.  A semantic compression model is developed to provide instructional videos at different level-of-details to accommodate dynamic network conditions and users’ system requirements.  We take advantage of the semantic compression algorithm’s ability to provide different layers of semantically equivalent video by adapting the client to play at the appropriate layer that provides the client with the richest possible viewing experience.  Video player actions, like play, pause and stop, can be initiated by any group member and and the results of those actions are synchronized with all the other students.  These features allow students to review a lecture video in tandem, facilitating the learning process. Experimental trials show that AI2TV successfully synchronizes instructional videos for distributed students while concurrently optimizing the video quality, even under conditions of fluctuating bandwidth, by adaptively adjusting the quality level for each student while still maintaining the invariant.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The content of a webpage is usually contained within a small
body of text and images, or perhaps several articles on the same page;
however, the content may be lost in the clutter (defined as cosmetic
features such as animations, menus, sidebars, obtrusive banners).
Automatic content extraction has many applications, including browsing on small cell phone and PDA screens, speech rendering for the visually
impaired, and reducing noise for information retrieval systems. We have
developed a framework, Crunch, which employs various heuristics for
content extraction in the form of filters applied to the webpage&#039;s DOM
tree; the filters aim to prune or transform the clutter, leaving only the content. Crunch allows users to tune what we call &quot;settings&quot;, consisting of thresholds for applying a particular filter and/or for toggling a filter on/off, because the HTML components that characterize clutter can vary significantly from website to website. However, we have found that the same settings tend to work well across different websites of the same genre, e.g., news or shopping, since the designers often employ similar page layouts. In particular, Crunch could obtain the settings for a previously unknown website by automatically classifying it as sufficiently similar to a cluster of known websites with previously adjusted settings. We present our approach to clustering a large corpus of websites into genres, using their pre-extraction textual material augmented by the snippets generated by searching for the website&#039;s domain name in web search engines. Including these snippets increases the frequency of function words needed for clustering. We use existing Manhattan distance measure and hierarchical clustering techniques, with some modifications, to pre-classify the corpus into genres offline. Our method does not require prior knowledge of the set of genres that websites fit into, but to be useful a priori settings must be available for some member of each cluster or a nearby cluster (otherwise defaults are used). Crunch classifies newly encountered websites online in linear-time, and then applies the corresponding filter settings, with no noticeable delay added by our content-extracting web proxy.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Event correlation is a widely-used data processing methodology for a broad variety of applications, and is especially useful in the context of distributed monitoring for software faults and vulnerabilities. However, most existing solutions have typically been focused on &quot;intra-organizational&quot; correlation; organizations typically employ privacy policies that prohibit the exchange of information outside of the organization. At the same time, the promise of &quot;inter-organizational&quot; correlation is significant given the broad availability of Internet-scale communications, and its potential role in both software maintenance and software vulnerability exploits.

In this proposal, I present a framework for reconciling these opposing forces in event correlation via the use of privacy preservation integrated into the event processing framework. By integrating flexible privacy policies, we enable the correlation of organizations&#039; data without actually releasing sensitive information. The framework supports both source anonymity and data privacy, yet allows for the time-based correlation of a broad variety of data. The framework is designed as a lightweight collection of components to enable integration with existing COTS platforms and distributed systems. I also present two different implementations of this framework: XUES (XML Universal Event Service), an event processor used as part of a software monitoring platform called KX (Kinesthetics eXtreme), and Worminator, a collaborative Intrusion Detection System.

KX comprised a series of components, connected together with a publish-subscribe content-based routing event subsystem, for the autonomic software monitoring of complex distributed systems. Sensors were installed in legacy systems. XUES&#039; two modules then performed event processing on sensor data: information was collected and processed by the Event Packager, and correlated using the Event Distiller. While XUES itself was not privacy-preserving, it laid the groundwork for this thesis by supporting event typing, the use of publish-subscribe and extensibility support via pluggable event transformation modules.

Worminator, the second implementation, extends the XUES platform to fully support privacy-preserving event types and algorithms in the context of a Collaborative Intrusion Detection System (CIDS), whereby sensor alerts can be exchanged and corroborated--a reduced form of correlation that enables collaborative verification--without revealing sensitive information about a contributor&#039;s network, services, or even external sources as required. Worminator also fully anonymizes source information, allowing contributors to decide their preferred level of information disclosure. Worminator is implemented as a monitoring framework on top of a COTS IDS sensor, and demonstrably enables the detection of not only worms but also &quot;broad and stealthy&quot; scans; traditional single-network sensors either bury such scans in large volumes or miss them entirely. Worminator has been successfully deployed at 5 collaborating sites and work is under way to scale it up further.

The contributions of this thesis include the development of a cross-application-domain event correlation framework with native privacy-preserving types, the use and validation of privacy-preserving corroboration, and the establishment of a practical deployed collaborative security system. I also outline the next steps in the thesis research plan, including the development of evaluation metrics to quantify Worminator&#039;s effectiveness at long-term scan detection, the overhead of privacy preservation and the effectiveness of our approach against adversaries, be they &quot;honest-but-curious&quot; or actively malicious. This thesis has broad future work implications, including privacy-preserving signature detection and distribution, distributed stealthy attacker profiling, and &quot;application community&quot;-based software vulnerability detection.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">In a previous paper, we developed a general framework for establishing
tractability and strong tractability for quasilinear multivariate
problems in the worst case setting.  One important example of such a
problem is the solution of the Poisson equation $-\Delta u + qu = f$
in the $d$-dimensional unit cube, in which $u$ depends linearly
on~$f$, but nonlinearly on~$q$.  Here, both $f$ and~$q$ are
$d$-variate functions from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with
finite-order weights of order~$\omega$.  This means that, although~$d$
can be arbitrary large, $f$ and~$q$ can be decomposed as sums of
functions of at most $\omega$~variables, with $\omega$ independent
of~$d$.

In this paper, we apply our previous general results to the Poisson
equation, subject to either Dirichlet or Neumann homogeneous boundary
conditions.  We study both the absolute and normalized error criteria.
For all four possible combinations of boundary conditions and error
criteria, we show that the problem is \emph{tractable}.  That is, the
number of evaluations of $f$ and~$q$ needed to obtain an
$\e$-approximation is polynomial in~$\e^{-1}$ and~$d$, with the degree
of the polynomial depending linearly on~$\omega$.  In addition, we
want to know when the problem is \emph{strongly tractable}, meaning
that the dependence is polynomial only in~$\e^{-1}$, independently
of~$d$.  We show that if the sum of the weights defining the weighted
reproducing kernel Hilbert space is uniformly bounded in~$d$ and the
integral of the univariate kernel is positive, then the Poisson
equation is strongly tractable for three of the four possible
combinations of boundary conditions and error criterion, the only
exception being the Dirichlet boundary condition under the normalized
error criterion.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) is a congestion control algorithm that provides a smooth transmission rate for real-time
network applications. TFRC refrains from halving the sending rate on every packet drop, instead it is adjusted as a function of
the loss rate during a single round trip time. TFRC has been proven to be fair when competing with TCP flows over congested
links, but it lacks quality-of-service parameters to improve the performance of real-time traffic. A problem with TFRC is that it
uses additive increase to adjust the sending rate during periods with no congestion. This leads to short term congestion that can
degrade the quality of voice applications.

We propose two changes to TFRC that improve the performance of VoIP applications. Our implementation, TFRC with Token
Bucket (TFRC-TB), uses discrete calculated bit rates based on audio codec bandwidth usage to increase the sending rate. Also, it
uses a token bucket to control the sending rate during congestion periods. We have used ns2, the network simulator, to compare
our implementation to TFRC in a wide range of network conditions. Our results suggest that TFRC-TB can provide a quality of
service (QoS) mechanism to voice applications while competing fairly with other traffic over congested links.</td>

We adapt square root algo­rithms, popular in Kalman filtering, to graphs with arbitrary topologies. The method consists of maintaining potentials and generating messages that involve the square root of precision matrices. Combining this with the machinery of the junction tree algorithm leads to an efficient and nu­merically stable algorithm. Experiments are presented to demonstrate the robustness of the method to numerical errors that can arise in com­plex learning and inference problems.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Scalability poses a significant challenge for today&#039;s web applications,
mainly due to the large population of potential users. To effectively
address the problem of short-term dramatic load spikes caused by web
hotspots, we developed a self-configuring and scalable rescue system
called DotSlash. The primary goal of our system is to provide dynamic
scalability to web applications by enabling a web site to obtain
resources dynamically, and use them autonomically without any
administrative intervention. To address the database server bottleneck,
DotSlash allows a web site to set up on-demand distributed query result
caching, which greatly reduces the database workload for read mostly
databases, and thus increases the request rate supported at a
DotSlash-enabled web site. The novelty of our work is that our query
result caching is on demand, and operated based on load conditions.
The caching remains inactive as long as the load is normal, but is
activated once the load is heavy. This approach offers good data
consistency during normal load situations, and good scalability with
relaxed data consistency for heavy load periods. We have built a
prototype system for the widely used LAMP configuration, and evaluated
our system using the RUBBoS bulletin board benchmark. Experiments show
that a DotSlash-enhanced web site can improve the maximum request rate
supported by a factor of 5 using 8 rescue servers for the RUBBoS
submission mix, and by a factor of 10 using 15 rescue servers for
the RUBBoS read-only mix.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Motivated by applications such as databases with nonuniform field lengths,
we introduce the concept of an elastic block cipher, a new
approach to variable length block ciphers which incorporates fixed
sized cipher components into a new network structure.  Our scheme
allows us to dynamically &quot;stretch&quot; the supported block size of
a block cipher up to a length double the original block size, while
increasing the computational workload proportionally to the
block size. We show that traditional attacks against an elastic block
cipher are impractical if the original cipher is secure. In this paper
we focus on differential and linear attacks. Specifically, we employ
an elastic version of Rijndael supporting block sizes of 128 to 256
bits as an example, and show it is resistant to both differential and
linear attacks. In particular, employing a different method than what
is employed in Rijndael design, we show that the probability of any
differential characteristic for the elastic version of Rijndael is
&lt;= 2^-(block size). We further prove that both linear and
nonlinear attacks are computationally infeasible for any elastic block
cipher if the original cipher is not subject to such an attack and
involves a block size for which an exhaustive plaintext search is
computationally infeasible (as is the case for Rijndael).</td>

The predominant defense against such attacks is to implement better input validation. This strategy is unlikely to succeed on its own. A better approach is to protect systems against SQL injection automatically and not rely on manual supervision or testing strategies (which are incomplete by nature). SQL randomization is a technique that defeats SQL injection attacks by transforming the language of SQL statements in a web application such that an attacker needs to guess the transformation in order to successfully inject his code.

We present PachyRand, an extension to the PostgreSQL JDBC driver that performs SQL randomization. Our system is easily portable to most other JDBC drivers, has a small performance impact, and makes SQL injection attacks infeasible.</td>

Our pointer analysis algorithm operates directly on the abstract syntax tree of a C program and uses a form of standard dataflow analysis to compute the desired points-to information.

We present an e-Learning architecture and adaptation model called AI2TV (Adaptive Internet Interactive Team Video), a system that allows borderless, virtual students, possibly some or all disadvantaged in network resources, to collaboratively view a video in synchrony. AI2TV upholds the invariant that each student will view semantically equivalent content at all times. Video player actions, like play, pause and stop, can be initiated by any of the students and the results of those actions are seen by all the other students. These features allow group members to review a lecture video in tandem to facilitate the learning process. We show in experimental trials that our system can successfully synchronize video for distributed students while, at the same time, optimizing the video quality given actual (fluctuating) bandwidth by adaptively adjusting the quality level for each student.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The tractability of multivariate problems has usually been studied only for the approximation of linear operators.  In this paper we study the tractability of quasilinear multivariate problems.  That is, we wish to approximate nonlinear operators~$S_d(\cdot,\cdot)$ that depend linearly on the first argument and satisfy a Lipschitz condition with respect to both arguments.  Here, both arguments are functions of $d$~variables.  Many computational problems of practical importance have this form.  Examples inlude the solution of specific Dirichlet, Neumann, and Schr\&quot;odinger problems.  We show, under appropriate assumptions, that quasilinear problems, whose domain spaces are equipped with product or finite-order weights, are tractable or strongly tractable in the worst case setting.

This paper is the first part in a series of papers.  Here, we present tractability results for quasilinear problems under general assumptions on quasilinear operators and weights.  In future papers, we shall verify these assumptions for quasilinear problems such as the solution of specific Dirichlet, Neumann, and Schr\&quot;odinger problems.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We consider the problem of learning a halfspace in the agnostic framework 
of Kearns et al., where a learner is given access to a distribution on labelled examples but the labelling may be arbitrary. The learner&#039;s goal is to output a hypothesis which performs almost as well as the optimal halfspace with respect to future draws from this distribution. Although the agnostic learning framework does not explicitly deal with noise, it is closely related to learning in worst-case noise models such as malicious noise.

We give the first polynomial-time algorithm for agnostically learning halfspaces with respect to several distributions, such as the uniform distribution over the $n$-dimensional Boolean cube {0,1}^n or unit sphere in n-dimensional Euclidean space, as well as any log-concave distribution in n-dimensional Euclidean space.  Given any constant additive factor eps&gt;0, our algorithm runs in poly(n) time and constructs a hypothesis whose error rate is within an additive eps of the optimal halfspace. We also show this algorithm agnostically learns Boolean disjunctions in time roughly 2^{\sqrt{n}} with respect to any distribution; this is the first subexponential-time algorithm for this problem. Finally, we obtain a new algorithm for PAC learning halfspaces under the uniform distribution on the unit sphere which can tolerate the highest level of malicious noise of any algorithm to date.

Our main tool is a polynomial regression algorithm which finds a polynomial that best fits a set of points with respect to a particular metric.  We show that, in fact, this algorithm is an arbitrary-distribution generalization of the well known ``low-degree&#039;&#039; Fourier algorithm of Linial, Mansour, &amp; Nisan and has excellent noise tolerance properties when minimizing with respect to the L_1 norm. We apply this algorithm in conjunction with a non-standard Fourier transform (which does not use the traditional parity basis) for learning halfspaces over the uniform distribution on the unit sphere; we believe this technique is of independent interest.</td>

this for $k = 2$ product distributions; our result answers an open

further give evidence that no polynomial time algorithm can succeed
when $k$ is superconstant, by reduction from a notorious open problem
in PAC learning.  Finally, we generalize our $\poly(n/\eps)$ time
algorithm to learn any mixture of $k = O(1)$ product distributions

constraint-based grammars, Lexicalized Well-Founded Grammars, which are
adequate for modeling human language and are learnable. These features
make the grammars suitable for developing robust and scalable natural language understanding systems. Our grammars capture both syntax and semantics and have two types of constraints at the rule level: one for semantic composition and one for ontology-based semantic interpretation. We prove that these grammars can always be learned from a small set of
semantically annotated, ordered representative examples, using a
relational learning algorithm. We introduce a new semantic
representation for natural language, which is suitable for an
ontology-based interpretation and allows us to learn the compositional
constraints together with the grammar rules. Besides the learnability
results, we give a principle for grammar merging. The experiments
presented in this paper show promising results for the adequacy of
these grammars in learning natural language. Relatively simple
linguistic knowledge is needed to build the small set of semantically
annotated examples required for the grammar induction.</td>

time-varying textures.  We make three contributions.  First, we
describe the carefully controlled acquisition of datasets of a variety
of natural processes including the growth of grass, the accumulation
of snow, and the oxidation of copper.  Second, we show how to adapt
quilting-based methods to time-varying texture synthesis, addressing
the important challenges of maintaining temporal coherence, efficient
synthesis on large time-varying datasets, and reducing visual
artifacts specific to time-varying textures.  Finally, we show how
simple procedural techniques can be used to control the evolution of
the results, such as allowing for a faster growth of grass in well lit

                    <td class="col-md-2">We consider a cluster of heterogeneous servers, modeled as $M/G/1$ queues with different processing speeds. The scheduling policies for these servers can be either processor-sharing or first-come first-serve. Furthermore, a dispatcher that assigns jobs to the servers takes as input only the size of the arriving job and the overall job-size distribution.
This general model captures the behavior of a variety of real systems, such as web server clusters. Our goal is to identify assignment strategies that the dispatcher can perform to minimize expected completion time and waiting time. We show that there exist optimal strategies that are deterministic, fixing the server to which jobs of particular sizes are always sent. We prove that the optimal strategy for systems with identical servers assigns a non-overlapping interval range of job sizes to each server. We then prove that when server processing speeds differ, it is necessary to assign each server a distinct set of intervals of job sizes in order to minimize expected waiting or response times. We explore some of the practical challenges of identifying the optimal strategy, and also study a related problem that uses our model of how to provision server processing speeds to minimize waiting and completion time given a job size distribution and fixed aggregate processing power.</td>

We tested this localization procedure on the campus of Columbia University with our mobile robot, the Autonomous Vehicle for Exploration and Navigation of Urban Environments. Our results indicate that localization accuracy is significantly improved when five levels of resolution are used instead of one in color histogramming. We also find that incorporating wireless signal strengths into the method further improves reliability and helps to resolve ambiguities which arise when different regions have similar visual appearances.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) allows multiple threads to supply instructions to the instruction pipeline of a superscalar processor. Because threads share processor resources, an SMT system is inherently different from a multiprocessor system and, therefore, utilizing multiple threads on an SMT processor creates new challenges for database implementers.
We investigate three thread-based techniques to exploit SMT architectures on memory-resident data. First, we consider running independent operations in separate threads, a technique applied to conventional multiprocessor systems. Second, we describe a novel implementation strategy in which individual operators are implemented in a multi-threaded fashion. Finally, we introduce a new data-structure called a work-ahead set that allows us to use one of the threads to aggressively preload data into the cache for use by the other thread.
We evaluate each method with respect to its performance, implementation complexity, and other measures. We also provide guidance regarding when and how to best utilize the various threading techniques. Our experimental results show that by taking advantage of SMT technology we achieve a 30\% to 70\% improvement in throughput over single threaded implementations on in-memory database operations.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The thesis contains an analysis of two computational problems. The first problem is discrete quantum Boolean summation. This problem is a building block of quantum algorithms for many continuous problems, such as integration, approximation, di®erential equations and path integration. The second problem is continuous multivariate
Feynman-Kac path integration, which is a special case of path integration. 

The quantum Boolean summation problem can be solved by the quantum summation (QS) algorithm of Brassard, Høyer, Mosca and Tapp, which approximates the arithmetic mean of a Boolean function. We improve the error bound of Brassard et al. for the worst-probabilistic setting. Our error bound is sharp. We also present new sharp error bounds in the average-probabilistic and worst-average settings. Our average-probabilistic error bounds prove the optimality of the QS algorithm for a certain choice of its parameters. The study of the worst-average error shows that the QS algorithm is not optimal in this setting; we need to use a certain number of repetitions to regain its optimality.

The multivariate Feynman-Kac path integration problem for smooth multivariate functions su®ers from the provable curse of dimensionality in the worst-case deterministic setting, i.e., the minimal number of function evaluations needed to compute an approximation depends exponentially on the number of variables. We show that in
both the randomized and quantum settings the curse of dimensionality is vanquished, i.e., the minimal number of function evaluations and/or quantum queries required to compute an approximation depends only polynomially on the reciprocal of the desired accuracy and has a bound independent of the number of variables. The exponents
of these polynomials are 2 in the randomized setting and 1 in the quantum setting. These exponents can be lowered at the expense of the dependence on the number of variables. Hence, the quantum setting yields exponential speedup over the worst-case
deterministic setting, and quadratic speedup over the randomized setting.</td>

Recent findings have revealed that the carriersensing range set in current major implementations does not detect and prevent all interference signals even using RTS/CTS access method together. In this paper, we investigate the effect of interference and develop a mathematical model for it. We demonstrate that the 802.11 DCF does not properly act on the interference channel due to the small size and the exponential increment of backoff windows. The accuracy of our model is verified via simulations. Based on an insight from our model, we present a simple protocol that operates on the top of 802.11 MAC layer and achieves more throughput than rate-adjustment schemes.</td>

A query is a procedure by which the quantum computer gains information about the specific problem. Different query definitions were given and our aim is to review them and to show that these definitions are not equivalent. To achieve this result we will study the simulation and approximation of one query type by another. While approximation is easy in one direction, we will show that it is hard in the other direction by a lower bound for the numbers of queries needed in the simulation. The main tool in this lower bound proof is a relationship between quantum algorithms and trigonometric polynomials that we will establish.</td>

on sensor/network topologies to secure control of rigidity. We
extend our previous approach for formations with symmetric

architecture. Necessary and sufficient conditions for stably
rigid directed formations are given including both cyclic and
acyclic directed formations. Some useful steps for creating
topologies of directed rigid formations are developed. An
algorithm to determine the directions of links to create
stably rigid directed formations from rigid undirected
formations is presented. It is shown that k-cycles (k &gt; 2) do
not cause inconsistencies when measurements are noisy, while
2-cycles do. Simulation results are presented for (i) a rigid
acyclic formation, (i) a flexible formation, and (iii) a rigid

The CVE employs a peer-to-peer approach to the frequent real-time updates to the 3D virtual worlds required by avatar movements (fellow students in the same room are depicted by avatars). This paper focuses on our extension to the P2P model to support group viewing of lecture videos, called VECTORS, for Video Enhanced Collaboration for Team Oriented Remote Synchronization. VECTORS supports synchronized viewing of lecture videos, so the students all see &quot;the same thing at the same time&quot;, and can pause, rewind, etc. in synchrony while discussing the lecture material via &quot;chat&quot;. We are particularly concerned with the needs of the technologically disenfranchised, e.g., whose only Web/Internet access if via dialup or other relatively low-bandwidth networking. Thus VECTORS employs semantically compressed videos with meager bandwidth requirements. Further, the videos are displayed as a sequence of JPEGs on the walls of a 3D virtual room, requiring fewer local multimedia resources than full motion MPEGs.</td>

We also review common route change detection methods and investigate rules to determine whether a route change happened in a node&#039;s forward-looking or backward-looking direction is detectable. We introduce typical NSIS deployment models and discuss specific categories of route changes that should be considered in each of these models. With the NSIS deployment models in mind, we further give experimental evaluation of two route change detection methods - the packet TTL monitoring method and a new delay variation monitoring method.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Web pages often contain clutter (such as ads, unnecessary images and extraneous links) around the body of an article, which distracts a user from actual content. Automatic extraction of &quot;useful and relevant&quot; content from web pages has many applications, including browsing on small cell phone and PDA screens, speech rendering for the visually impaired, and reducing noise for information retrieval systems. Prior work has led to the development of Crunch, a framework which employs various heuristics in the form of filters and filter settings for content extraction. Crunch allows users to tune these settings, essentially the thresholds for applying each filter. However, in order to reduce human involvement in selecting these heuristic settings, we have extended this work to utilize a website&#039;s classification, defined by its genre and physical layout. In particular, Crunch would then obtain the settings for a previously unknown website by automatically classifying it as sufficiently similar to a cluster of known websites with previously adjusted settings - which in practice produces better content extraction results than a single one-size-fits-all set of setting defaults. In this paper, we present our approach to clustering a large corpus of websites by their genre, utilizing the snippets generated by sending the website&#039;s domain name to search engines as well as the website&#039;s own text. We find that exploiting these snippets not only increased the frequency of function words that directly assist in detecting the genre of a website, but also allow for easier clustering of websites. We use existing techniques like Manhattan distance measure and Hierarchical clustering, with some modifications, to pre-classify websites into genres. Our clustering method does not require prior knowledge of the set of genres that websites fit into, but instead discovers these relationships among websites. Subsequently, we are able to classify newly encountered websites in linear-time, and then apply the corresponding filter settings, with no noticeable delay introduced for the content-extracting web proxy.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Event correlation is essential to realizing self-managing distributed systems. For example, distributed systems often require that events be correlated from multiple systems using temporal patterns to detect denial of service attacks and to warn of problems with business critical applications that run on multiple servers. This paper addresses how to specify timer values for temporal patterns so as to manage the trade-off between false alarms and undetected alarms. A central concern is addressing the variability of event propagation delays due to factors such as contention for network and server resources. To this end, we develop an architecture and an adaptive control algorithm that dynamically compensate for variations in propagation delays. Our approach makes Management Stations more autonomic by avoiding the need for manual adjustments of timer values in temporal rules. Further, studies we conducted of a testbed system suggest that our approach produces results that are at least as good as an optimal fixed setting of timer values.</td>

The autonomic controller monitors video state at the clients&#039; end, and adapts the quality of the video according to the resources of each client in (soft) real time.

As designs written in a hardware description language such as Esterel inherently carry more high level information that a register transfer level model, such information can be used to guide the encoding process. A question arises if the high level information alone is strong enough to suggest an efficient state assignment, allowing low-level details to be ignored.
This report suggests that with Esterel&#039;s flexibility, most optimization potential is not within the high-level structure. It appears effective state assignment cannot rely solely on high level information.</td>

This is usually done manually through code inspections. We propose a type inference algorithm able to infer basic information about the library functions a particular C program uses in the absence of declaration information for the library (e.g., without header files). Based on a simple but efficient inference algorithm, we were able to infer declarations for much of the PalmOS API from the source of a twenty-seven-thousand-line C program. Such a tool will aid in the problem of program understanding when porting programs, especially from poorly-documented or lost legacy environments.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Software that covertly monitors user actions, also known as {\it
spyware,} has become a first-level security threat due to its ubiquity
and the difficulty of detecting and removing it. Such software may be
inadvertently installed by a user that is casually browsing the web,
or may be purposely installed by an attacker or even the owner of a
system. This is particularly problematic in the case of utility
computing, early manifestations of which are Internet cafes and
thin-client computing. Traditional trusted computing approaches offer
a partial solution to this by significantly increasing the size of the
trusted computing base (TCB) to include the operating system and other
software.

We examine the problem of protecting a user accessing specific
services in such an environment. We focus on secure video broadcasts
and remote desktop access when using any convenient, and often
untrusted, terminal as two example applications.  We posit that, at
least for such applications, the TCB can be confined to a suitably
modified graphics processing unit (GPU). Specifically, to prevent
spyware on untrusted clients from accessing the user&#039;s data, we
restrict the boundary of trust to the client&#039;s GPU by moving image
decryption into GPUs. We use the GPU in order to leverage existing
capabilities as opposed to designing a new component from scratch.
We discuss the applicability of GPU-based
decryption in these two sample scenarios and identify the limitations
of the current generation of GPUs. We propose straightforward
modifications to future GPUs that will allow the realization of the
full approach.</td>

We have implemented a prototype in Linux that works with existing unmodified applications and operating system kernels. Our experimental results demonstrate that WebPod has very low virtualization overhead and can provide a full featured web browsing experience, including support for all helper applications and plug-ins one expects.

                    <td class="col-md-2">After a few decades of research and experimentation, register-transfer dialects of two standard languages---Verilog and VHDL---have emerged as the industry standard starting point for automatic large-scale digital integrated circuit synthesis. Writing RTL descriptions of hardware remains a largely human process and hence the clarity, precision, and ease with which such descriptions can be coded correctly has a profound impact on the quality of the final product and the speed with which the design can be created.
While the efficiency of a design (e.g., the speed at which it can run or the power it consumes) is obviously important, its correctness is usually the paramount issue, consuming the majority of the time (and hence money) spent during the design process. In response to this challenge, a number of so-called verification languages have arisen. These have been designed to assist in a simulation-based or formal verification process by providing mechanisms for checking temporal properties, generating pseudorandom test cases, and for checking how much of a design&#039;s behavior has been exercised by the test cases.
Through examples and discussion, this report describes the two main design languages---VHDL and Verilog---as well as SystemC, a language currently used to build large simulation models; SystemVerilog, a substantial extension of Verilog; and OpenVera, e, and PSL, the three leading contenders for becoming the main verification language.</td>

In our previous work [16], we developed a framework that employed an easily extensible set of techniques that incorporated results from our earlier work on content extraction [16]. Our insight was to work with DOM trees, rather than raw HTML markup. We present here filters that reduce human involvement in applying heuristic settings for websites and instead automate the job by detecting and utilizing the physical layout and content genre of a given website. We also present work we have done towards improving the usability and performance of our content extraction proxy as well as the quality and accuracy of the heuristics that act as filters for inferring the context of a webpage.</td>

Internet telephony can be viewed as an application of P2P architecture where the participants form a self-organizing P2P overlay network to locate and communicate with other participants. We propose a pure P2P architecture for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-based IP telephony systems. Our P2P-SIP architecture supports basic user registration and call setup as well as advanced services such as offline message delivery, voice/video mails and multi-party conferencing. We also provide an overview of practical challenges for P2P-SIP such as firewall, Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal and security.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Internet telephony can introduce many novel communication services, however, novelty puts learning burden on users. It will be a great help to users if their desired services can be created automatically. We developed an intelligent communication service creation environment which can handle automatic service creation by learning from users&#039; daily communication behaviors. The service creation environment models communication services as decision trees and uses the Incremental Tree Induction (ITI) algorithm for decision tree learning. We use Language for End System Services (LESS) scripts to represent learned results and implemented a simulation environment to verify the learning algorithm. We also noticed that when users get their desired services, they may not be aware of unexpected behaviors that the serivces could introduce, for example, mistakenly rejecting expected calls. In this paper, we also did a comprehensive analysis on communication service fail-safe handling and propose several approaches to create fail-safe services.</td>

by crystallographers for this task.  We have used micro-electrical
mechanical system (MEMS) techniques to design and manufacture various

lowers a microshovel into the liquid containing the crystals for poking

As is evident from the fate of email, protection against spam has to be built into SIP systems otherwise they are bound to fall prey to spam. Traditional approaches used to prevent spam in email such as content-based filtering and access lists are not applicable to SIP calls and instant messages in their present form. We propose Domain-based Authentication and Policy-Enforced for SIP (DAPES): a system that can be easily implemented and deployed in existing SIP networks. Our system is capable of determining in real time, whether an incoming call or instant message is likely to be spam or not, while at the same time, supporting communication between both known and unknown parties. DAPES includes the deployment of reputation systems in SIP networks to enable real-time transfer of reputation information between parties to allow communication between entities unknown to each other.</td>

These services require a service programming architecture that can easily incorporate new Internet services into the existing conferencing functionalities, such as voice-enabled conference control. W3C has defined the Call Control eXtensible Markup Language (CCXML), along with its VoiceXML, for telephony call control services in a point-to-point call. However, it cannot handle other Internet service events such as presence enabled conferences. In this paper, we propose an architecture combining VoiceXML with our Language for End System Services (LESS) and the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) for multi-party conference service programming that integrates existing Internet services. VoiceXML provides the voice interface to LESS and CGI scripts. Our architecture enables many novel services such as conference setup based on participant location and presence status. We give some examples of the new services and describe our on-going implementation.</td>

Our emphasis is in creating &quot;self-healing&quot; software that can protect itself against a recurring fault until a more comprehensive fix is applied.
Our system consists of a set of sensors that monitor applications for various types of failure and an instruction-level emulator that is invoked for selected parts of a program&#039;s code. Use of such an emulator allows us to predict recurrences of faults, and recover program execution to a safe control flow. Using the emulator for small pieces of code, as directed by the sensors, allows us to minimize the performance impact on the immunized application.
We discuss the overall system architecture and a prototype implementation for the x86 platform. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach against a range of attacks and other software failures and investigate its performance impact on several server-type applications. We conclude that our system is effective in preventing the recurrence of a wide variety of software failures at a small performance cost.</td>

A formation is a group of agents moving in real 2- or 3- dimensional space. A formation is called rigid if the distance between each pair of agents does not change over time under ideal conditions. Sensing/communication links between agents are used to maintain a rigid formation. Two agents connected by a sensing/communication link are called neighbors. There are two types of neighbor relations in rigid formations. In the first type, the neighbor relation is symmetric. In the second type, the neighbor relation is asymmetric. Rigid formations with a leader-follower structure have the asymmetric neighbor relation. A framework to analyze rigid formations with symmetric neighbor relations is given in our previous work. This paper suggests an approach to analyze rigid formations that have a leader-follower structure.</td>

The performance of UDP is better than that of TCP NODELAY and the performance TCP NODELAY is better than that of TCP. We also explore the relation between TCP delay time minus the transmission time and the packet loss rate and find there is a linear relationship between them.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We examine the problem of containing buffer overflow attacks in a safe and efficient manner. Briefly, we automatically augment source code to dynamically catch stack and heap-based buffer overflow and underflow attacks, and recover from them by allowing the program to continue execution. Our hypothesis is that we can treat each code function as a transaction that can be aborted when an attack is detected, without affecting the application&#039;s ability to correctly execute. Our approach allows us to selectively enable or disable components of this defensive mechanism in response to external events, allowing for a direct tradeoff between security and performance. We combine our defensive mechanism with a honeypot-like con guration to detect previously unknown attacks and automatically adapt an application&#039;s defensive posture at a negligible performance cost, as well as help determine a worm&#039;s signature. The main benefits of our scheme are its low impact on application performance, its ability to respond to attacks without human intervention, its capacity to handle previously unknown vulnerabilities, and the preservation of service availability. We implemented a stand-alone tool, DYBOC, which we use to instrument a number of vulnerable applications. Our performance benchmarks indicate a slow-down of 20% for Apache in full-protection mode, and 1.2% with partial protection. We validate our transactional hypothesis via two experiments: first, by applying our scheme to 17 vulnerable applications, successfully fixing 14 of them; second, by examining the behavior of Apache when each of 154 potentially vulnerable routines are made to fail, resulting in correct behavior in 139 of cases.</td>

For efficiency, metasearchers rely on succinct statistical summaries of the database contents to select the best databases for each query. So far, database selection research has largely assumed that databases are static, so the associated statistical summaries do not need to change over time. However, databases are rarely static and the statistical summaries that describe their contents need to be updated periodically to reflect content changes. In this paper, we first report the results of a study showing how the content summaries of 152 real web databases evolved over a period of 52 weeks. Then, we show how to use ``survival analysis&#039;&#039; techniques in general, and Cox&#039;s proportional hazards regression in particular, to model database changes over time and predict when we should update each content summary. Finally, we exploit our change model to devise update schedules that keep the summaries up to date by contacting databases only when needed, and then we evaluate the quality of our schedules experimentally over real web databases.</td>

We present Group Ratio Round-Robin ($GR^3$), the	first proportional share scheduler that combines accurate	proportional fairness scheduling behavior with $O(1)$	scheduling overhead on both uniprocessor and multiprocessor	systems. $GR^3$ uses a novel client grouping strategy to	organize clients into groups of similar processor allocations	which can be more easily scheduled. Using this grouping	strategy, $GR^3$ combines the benefits of low overhead	round-robin execution with a novel ratio-based scheduling	algorithm. $GR^3$ can provide fairness within a constant	factor of the ideal generalized processor sharing model for	client weights with a fixed upper bound and preserves its	fairness properties on multiprocessor systems. We have	implemented $GR^3$ in Linux and measured its performance	against other schedulers commonly used in research and	practice, including the standard Linux scheduler, Weighted	Fair Queueing, Virtual-Time Round-Robin, and Smoothed	Round-Robin. Our experimental results demonstrate that $GR^3$	can provide much lower scheduling overhead and much better	scheduling accuracy in practice than these other approaches.</td>

We introduce THINC, a remote display system architecture for high-performance thin-client computing in both LAN and WAN environments. THINC transparently maps high-level application display calls to a few simple low-level commands which can be implemented easily and efficiently. THINC introduces a number of novel latency-sensitive optimization techniques, including offscreen drawing awareness, command buffering and scheduling, non-blocking display operation, native video support, and server-side screen scaling. We have implemented THINC in an XFree86/Linux environment and compared its performance with other popular approaches, including Citrix MetaFrame, Microsoft Terminal Services, SunRay, VNC, and X. Our experimental results on web and video applications demonstrate that THINC can be as much as five times faster than traditional thin-client systems in high latency network environments and is capable of playing full-screen video at full frame rate.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">This paper addresses the problem of efficiently calculating shadows from environment maps. Since accurate rendering of shadows from environment maps requires hundreds of lights, the expensive computation is determining visibility from each pixel to each light direction, such as by ray-tracing. We show that coherence in both spatial and angular domains can be used to reduce the number of shadow rays that need to be traced. Specifically, we use a coarse-to-fine evaluation of the image, predicting visibility by reusing visibility calculations from four nearby pixels that have already been evaluated. This simple method allows us to explicitly mark regions of uncertainty in the prediction. By only tracing rays in these and neighboring directions, we are able to reduce the number of shadow rays traced by up to a factor of 20 while maintaining error rates below 0.01\%. For many scenes, our algorithm can add shadowing from hundreds of lights at twice the cost of rendering without shadows.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Asynchronous (or ``clock-less&#039;&#039;) digital circuit design has received much attention over the past few years, including its introduction into consumer products. One major bottleneck to the further advancement of clock-less design is the lack of optimizing CAD (computer-aided design) algorithms and tools. In synchronous design, CAD packages have been crucial to the advancement of the microelectronics industry. In fact, automated methods seem to be even more crucial for asynchronous design, which is widely considered as being much more error-prone.
This thesis proposes several new efficient CAD techniques for the design of asynchronous control circuits. The contributions include: (i) two new and very efficient algorithms for hazard-free two-level logic minimization, including a heuristic algorithm, ESPRESSO-HF, and an exact algorithm based on implicit data structures, IMPYMIN; and (ii) a new synthesis and optimization method for large-scale asynchronous systems, which starts from a Control-Dataflow Graph (CDFG), and produces highly-optimized distributed control.
As a case study, this latter method is applied to a differential equation solver; the resulting synthesized circuit is comparable in quality to a highly-optimized manual design.</td>

                      Orchestrating the Dynamic Adaptation of Distributed Software with Process Technology

                    <td class="col-md-2">Software systems are becoming increasingly complex to develop, understand, analyze, validate, deploy, configure, manage and maintain. Much of that complexity is related to ensuring adequate quality levels to services provided by software systems after they are deployed in the field, in particular when those systems are built from and operated as a mix of proprietary and non-proprietary components. That translates to increasing costs and difficulties when trying to operate large-scale distributed software ensembles in a way that continuously guarantees satisfactory levels of service.
A solution can be to exert some form of dynamic adaptation upon running software systems: dynamic adaptation can be defined as a set of automated and coordinated actions that aim at modifying the structure, behavior and performance of a target software system, at run time and without service interruption, typically in response to the occurrence of some condition(s). To achieve dynamic adaptation upon a given target software system, a set of capabilities, including monitoring, diagnostics, decision, actuation and coordination, must be put in place.
This research addresses the automation of decision and coordination in the context of an end-to-end and externalized approach to dynamic adaptation, which allows to address as its targets legacy and component-based systems, as well as new systems developed from scratch. In this approach, adaptation provisions are superimposed by a separate software platform, which operates from the outside of and orthogonally to the target application as a whole; furthermore, a single adaptation possibly spans concerted interventions on a multiplicity of target components. To properly orchestrate those interventions, decentralized process technology is employed for describing, activating and coordinating the work of a cohort of software actuators, towards the intended end-to-end dynamic adaptation.
The approach outlined above, has been implemented in a prototype, code-named Workflakes, within the Kinesthetics eXtreme project investigating externalized dynamic adaptation, carried out by the Programming Systems Laboratory of Columbia University, and has been employed in a set of diverse case studies. This dissertation discusses and evaluates the concept of process-based orchestration of dynamic adaptation and the Workflakes prototype on the basis of the results of those case studies.</td>

However, this scalability comes at the expense of increased vulnerability to specific types of attacks. In this paper, we focus on insider denial of service (DoS) attacks on such systems. In these attacks, nodes that are part of the DHT system are compromised and used to flood other nodes in the DHT with excessive request traffic.
We devise a distributed lightweight protocol that detects such attacks, implemented solely within nodes that participate in the DHT. Our approach exploits inherent structural invariants of DHTs to ferret out attacking nodes whose request patterns deviate from ``normal&#039;&#039; behavior. We evaluate our protocol&#039;s ability to detect attackers via simulation within a Chord network. The results show that our system can detect a simple attacker whose attack traffic deviates by as little as 5\% from a normal request traffic. We also demonstrate the resiliency of our protocol to coordinated attacks by up to as many as 25\% of nodes. Our work shows that DHTs can protect themselves from insider flooding attacks, eliminating an important roadblock to their deployment and use in untrusted environments.</td>

The system is intended to be used not as a standalone detector but one of a correlated set of host-based sensors. The detector has two parts, a sensor that audits file systems accesses, and an unsupervised machine learning system that computes normal models of those accesses.We report on the architecture of the file system sensor implemented on Linux using the FiST file wrapper technology and results of the anomaly detector applied to experimental data acquired from this sensor. FWRAP employs the Probabilistic Anomaly Detection (PAD) algorithm previously reported in our work on Windows Registry Anomaly Detection. The detector is first trained by operating the host computer for some amount of time and a model specific to the target machine is automatically computed by PAD, intended to be deployed to a real-time detector. In this paper we describe the feature set used to model file system accesses, and the performance results of a set of experiments using the sensor while attacking a Linux host with a variety of malware exploits. The PAD detector achieved impressive detection rates in some cases over 95\% and about a 2\% false positive rate when alarming on anomalous processes.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The high cost of ownership of computing systems has resulted in a number of industry initiatives to reduce the burden of operations and management.  Examples include IBM&#039;s Autonomic Computing, HP&#039;s Adaptive Infrastructure, and Microsoft&#039;s Dynamic Systems Initiative. All of these efforts seek to reduce operations costs by increased automation, ideally to have systems be self-managing without any human intervention (since operator error has been identified as a major source of system failures). While the concept of automated operations has existed for two decades, as a way to adapt to changing workloads, failures and (more recently) attacks, the scope of automation remains limited. We believe this is in part due to the absence of a fundamental understanding of how automated actions affect system behavior, especially system stability.
Other disciplines such as mechanical, electrical, and aeronautical engineering make use of control theory to design feedback systems. This paper uses control theory as a way to identify a number of requirements for and challenges in building self-managing systems,

                    <td class="col-md-2">Video cameras must produce images at a reasonable frame-rate and with a reasonable depth of field. These requirements impose fundamental physical limits on the spatial resolution of the image detector. As a result, current cameras produce videos with a very low resolution. The resolution of videos can be computationally enhanced by moving the camera and applying super-resolution reconstruction algorithms. However, a moving camera introduces motion blur, which limits super-resolution quality. We analyze this effect and derive a theoretical result showing that motion blur has a substantial degrading effect on the performance of super resolution. The conclusion is, that in order to achieve the highest resolution, motion blur should be avoided.
Motion blur can be minimized by sampling the space-time volume of the video in a specific manner. We have developed a novel camera, called the jitter camera, that achieves this sampling. By applying an adaptive super-resolution algorithm to the video produced by the jitter camera, we show that resolution can be notably enhanced for stationary or slowly moving objects, while it is improved slightly or left unchanged for objects with fast and complex motions. The end result is a video that has a significantly higher resolution than the captured one.</td>

Unlike existing \textsc{rtl} synthesis approaches, this approach frees the designer from tedious bit-level state encoding and certain types of inter-machine communication. Experimental results suggest that even with a fairly primitive state assignment heuristic, our compiler consistently produces smaller, slightly faster circuits that the existing Esterel compiler. We mainly attribute this to a different style of distributing state bits throughout the circuit. Initial results are encouraging, but some hand-optimized encodings suggest room for a better state assignment algorithm. We are confident that such improvements will make our technique even more practical.</td>

MobiDesk transparently virtualizes a user&#039;s computing session by abstracting underlying system resources in three key areas: display, operating system and network. MobiDesk provides a thin virtualization layer that decouples a user&#039;s computing session from any particular end user device and moves all application logic from end user devices to hosting providers. MobiDesk virtualization decouples a user&#039;s computing session from the underlying operating system and server instance, enabling high availability service by transparently migrating sessions from one server to another during server maintenance or upgrades. We have implemented a MobiDesk prototype in Linux that works with existing unmodified applications and operating system kernels. Our experimental results demonstrate that MobiDesk has very low virtualization overhead, can provide a full-featured desktop experience including full-motion video support, and is able to migrate users&#039; sessions efficiently and reliably for high availability, while maintaining existing network connections.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Database selection is an important step when searching over large numbers of distributed text databases. The database selection task relies on statistical summaries of the database contents, which are not typically exported by databases. Previous research has developed algorithms for constructing an approximate content summary of a text database from a small document sample extracted via querying. Unfortunately, Zipf&#039;s law practically guarantees that content summaries built this way for any relatively large database will fail to cover many low-frequency words. Incomplete content summaries might negatively affect the database selection process, especially for short queries with infrequent words. To improve the coverage of approximate content summaries, we build on the observation that topically similar databases tend to have related vocabularies. Therefore, the approximate content summaries of topically related databases can complement each other and increase their coverage. Specifically, we exploit a (given or derived) hierarchical categorization of the databases and adapt the notion of ``shrinkage&#039;&#039; --a form of smoothing that has been used successfully for document classification-- to the content summary construction task. A thorough evaluation over 315 real web databases as well as over TREC data suggests that the shrinkage-based content summaries are substantially more complete than their ``unshrunk&#039;&#039; counterparts. We also describe how to modify existing database selection algorithms to adaptively decide --at run-time-- whether to apply shrinkage for a query. Our experiments, which rely on TREC data sets, queries, and the associated ``relevance judgments,&#039;&#039; show that our shrinkage-based approach is significantly more accurate than state-of-the-art database selection algorithms, including a recently proposed hierarchical strategy that also exploits database classification.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The rapidly increasing array of Internet-scale threats is a pressing problem for every organization that utilizes the network. Organizations often have limited resources to detect and respond to these threats. The sharing of information related to probes and attacks is a facet of an emerging trend toward &quot;collaborative security.&quot; Collaborative security mechanisms provide network administrators with a valuable tool in this increasingly hostile environment.
The perceived benefit of a collaborative approach to intrusion detection is threefold: greater clarity about attacker intent, precise models of adversarial behavior, and a better view of global network attack activity. While many organizations see value in adopting such a collaborative approach, several critical problems must be addressed before intrusion detection can be performed on an inter-organizational scale. These obstacles to collaborative intrusion detection often go beyond the merely technical; the relationships between cooperating organizations impose additional constraints on the amount and type of information to be shared.
We propose a completely decentralized system that can efficiently distribute alerts to each collaborating peer. The system is composed of two major components that embody the main contribution of our research. The first component, named Worminator, is a tool for extracting relevant information from alert streams and encoding it in Bloom filters. The second component, Whirlpool, is a software system for scheduling correlation relationships between peer nodes. The combination of these systems accomplishes alert distribution in a scalable manner and without violating the privacy of each administrative domain.</td>

In addition, the introduction of lecture videos into the online curriculum has drawn attention to the disparity in the network resources used by the students. We present an architecture and adaptation model called AI2TV (Adaptive Internet Interactive Team Video), a system that allows geographically dispersed participants, possibly some or all disadvantaged in network resources, to collaboratively view a video in synchrony. AI2TV upholds the invariant that each participant will view semantically equivalent content at all times. Video player actions, like play, pause and stop, can be initiated by any of the participants and the results of those actions are seen by all the members. These features allow group members to review a lecture video in tandem to facilitate the learning process. We employ an autonomic (feedback loop) controller that monitors clients&#039; video status and adjusts the quality of the video according to the resources of each client. We show in experimental trials that our system can successfully synchronize video for distributed clients while, at the same time, optimizing the video quality given actual (fluctuating) bandwidth by adaptively adjusting the quality level for each participant.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We introduce a new concept of elastic block ciphers, symmetric-key encryption algorithms that for a variable size input do not expand the plaintext, (i.e., do not require plaintext padding), while maintaining the diffusion property of traditional block ciphers and adjusting their computational load proportionally to the size increase. Elastic block ciphers are ideal for applications where length-preserving encryption is most beneficial, such as protecting variable-length database entries or network packets.
We present a general algorithmic schema for converting a traditional block cipher, such as AES, to its elastic version, and analyze the security of the resulting cipher. Our approach allows us to ``stretch&#039;&#039; the supported block size of a block cipher up to twice the original length, while increasing the computational load proportionally to the block size. Our approach does not allow us to use the original cipher as a ``black box&#039;&#039; (i.e., as an ideal cipher or a pseudorandom permutation as is used in constructing modes of encryption). Nevertheless, under some reasonable conditions on the cipher&#039;s structure and its key schedule, we reduce the security of the elastic version to that of the fixed size block cipher. This schema and the security reduction enable us to capitalize on secure ciphers and their already established security properties in elastic designs. We note that we are not aware of previous ``reduction type&#039;&#039; proofs of security in the area of concrete (i.e., non ``black-box&#039;&#039;) block cipher design. Our implementation of the elastic version of AES, which accepts blocks of all sizes in the range 128 to 255 bits, was measured to be almost twice as fast when encrypting plaintext that is only a few bits longer than a full block (A128 bits), when compared to traditional ``pad and block-encrypt&#039;&#039; approach.</td>

DotSlash allows different web sites to form a mutual-aid community, and use spare capacity in the community to relieve web hotspots experienced by any individual site. As a rescue system, DotSlash intervenes when a web site becomes heavily loaded, and is phased out once the workload returns to normal. It aims to complement existing web server infrastructure such as CDNs to handle short-term load spikes effectively, but is not intended to support a request load constantly higher than a web site&#039;s planned capacity. DotSlash is scalable, cost-effective, easy to use, self-configuring, and transparent to clients. It targets small web sites, although large web site can also benefit from it. We have implemented a prototype of DotSlash on top of Apache. Experiments show that DotSlash can provide an order of magnitude improvement for a web server in terms of the request rate supported and the data rate delivered to clients even if only HTTP redirect is used. Parts of this work may be applicable to other services such as the Grid computational services and media streaming.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Sting applications often contain security holes that are not patched until after the system has already been compromised. Even when software updates are applied to address security issues, they often result in system services being unavailable for some time. To address these system security and availability issues, we have developed peas and pods. A pea provides a least privilege environment that can restrict processes to the minimal subset of system resources needed to run. This mechanism enables the creation of environments for privileged program execution that can help with intrusion prevention and containment. A pod provides a group of processes and associated users with a consistent, machine-independent virtualized environment. Pods are coupled with a novel checkpoint-restart mechanism which allows processes to be migrated across minor operating system kernel versions with different security patches. This mechanism allows system administrators the flexibility to patch their operating systems immediately without worrying over potential loss of data or needing to schedule system downtime. We have implemented peas and pods in Linux without requiring any application or operating system kernel changes. Our measurements on real world desktop and server applications demonstrate that peas and pods impose little overhead and enable secure isolation and migration of untrusted applications.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Internet telephony end systems can offer many services. Different services may interfere with each other, a problem which is known as feature interaction. The feature interaction problem has existed in telecommunication systems for many years. The introduction of Internet telephony helps to solve some interaction problems due to the richness of its signaling information. However, many new feature interaction problems are also introduced in Internet telephony systems, especially in end systems, which are usually dumb in PSTN systems, but highly functional in Internet telephony systems. Internet telephony end systems, such as SIP soft-agents, can run on personal computers. The soft-agents can then perform call control and many other functions, such as presence information handling, instant messaging, and network appliance control. These new functionalities make the end system feature interaction problems more complicated. In this paper, we investigate ways features interact in Internet telephony end systems and propose a potential solution for detecting and avoiding feature interactions. Our solutions are based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Language for End System Services (LESS), which is a markup language specifically for end system service creation.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We study the complexity of Fredholm problems of the second kind $u - \int_\Omega k(\cdot,y)u(y)\,dy = f$. Previous work on the complexity of this problem has assumed that $\Omega$ was the unit cube~$I^d$. In this paper, we allow~$\Omega$ to be part of the data specifying an instance of the problem, along with~$k$ and~$f$. More precisely, we assume that $\Omega$ is the diffeomorphic image of the unit $d$-cube under a $C^{r_1}$ mapping~$\rho\:I^d\to I^l$. In addition, we assume that $k\in C^{r_2}(I^{2l})$ and $f\in W^{r_3,p}(I^l)$ with $r_3&gt;l/p$. Our information about the problem data is contaminated by $\delta$-bounded noise. Error is measured in the $L_p$-sense. We find that the $n$th minimal error is bounded from below by $\Theta(n^{-\mu_1}+\delta)$ and from above by $\Theta(n^{-\mu_2}+\delta)$, where $$\mu_1 = \min\left\{\frac{r_1}{d}, \frac{r_2}{2d}, \frac{r_3-(d-l)/p}d\right\} \qquad\text{and}\qquad \mu_2 = \min\left\{\frac{r_1-\nu}d, \frac{r_2}{2d}, \frac{r_3-(l-d)/p}d\right\},$$ with $$\nu = \begin{cases} \displaystyle\frac{d}p &amp; \text{if $r_1\ge 2$, $r_2\ge2$, and $d\le p$},\\ &amp; \\ 1 &amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases}$$ In particular, the $n$th minimal error is proportional to $\Theta(n^{-\mu_1}+\delta)$ when $p=\infty$. The upper bound is attained by a noisy modified Galerkin method, which can be efficiently implemented using multigrid techniques. We thus find bounds on the $\varepsilon$-complexity of the problem, these bounds depending on the cost $\mathbf{c}(\delta)$ of calculating a $\delta$-noisy function value. As an example, if $\mathbf{c}(\delta)=\delta^{-b}$, we find that the $\varepsilon$-complexity is between $(1/\varepsilon)^{b+1/\mu_1}$ and $(1/\varepsilon)^{b+1/\mu_2}$.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">One frequently cited reason for the lack of wide deployment of cryptographic protocols is the (perceived) poor performance of the algorithms they employ and their impact on the rest of the system. Although high-performance dedicated cryptographic accelerator cards have been commercially available for some time, market penetration remains low. We take a different approach, seeking to exploit {\it existing system resources,} such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate cryptographic processing.
We exploit the ability for GPUs to simultaneously process large quantities of pixels to offload cryptographic processing from the main processor. We demonstrate the use of GPUs for stream ciphers, which can achieve 75\% the performance of a fast CPU. We also investigate the use of GPUs for block ciphers, discuss operations that make certain ciphers unsuitable for use with a GPU, and compare the performance of an OpenGL-based implementation of AES with implementations utilizing general CPUs. In addition to offloading system resources, the ability to perform encryption and decryption within the GPU has potential applications in image processing by limiting exposure of the plaintext to within the GPU.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Web pages often contain clutter (such as unnecessary images and extraneous links) around the body of an article that distracts a user from actual content. Extraction of &quot;useful and relevant&quot; content from web pages has many applications, including cell phone and PDA browsing, speech rendering for the visually impaired, and text summarization. Most approaches to making content more readable involve changing font size or removing HTML and data components such as images, which takes away from a webpage&#039;s inherent look and feel. Unlike &quot;Content Reformatting&quot;, which aims to reproduce the entire webpage in a more convenient form, our solution directly addresses &quot;Content Extraction&quot;. We have developed a framework that employs an easily extensible set of techniques. It incorporates advantages of previous work on content extraction. Our key insight is to work with DOM trees, a W3C specified interface that allows programs to dynamically access document structure, rather than with raw HTML markup. We have implemented our approach in a publicly available Web proxy to extract content from HTML web pages. This proxy can be used both centrally, administered for groups of users, as well as by individuals for personal browsers. We have also, after receiving feedback from users about the proxy, created a revised version with improved performance and accessibility in mind.</td>

With the introduction of AOL&#039;s version 5.2.3211 of the AIM client, users can optionally encrypt and protect the integrity of their conversation. Taking advantage of the encryption capabilities of the AIM client requires that signed certificates for both parties be available. AIM (through VeriSign) makes such certificates available for purchase. However, in a ``public service&#039;&#039; effort to defray the cost of purchasing personal certificates to protect IM conversations, a website (www.aimencrypt.com) is offering a certificate free of cost for download.

We propose an architecture for automatically repairing software flaws that are exploited by zero-day worms.Our approach relies on source code transformations to quickly apply automatically-created (and tested) localized patches to vulnerable segments of the targeted application. To determine these susceptible portions, we use a sandboxed instance of the application as a ``clean room&#039;&#039; laboratory that runs in parallel with the production system and exploit the fact that a worm must reveal its infection vector to achieve its goal ( i.e., further infection). We believe our approach to be the first end-point solution to the problem of malicious self-replicating code. The primary benefits of our approach are (a) its low impact on application performance, (b) its ability to respond to attacks without human intervention, and (c) its capacity to deal with zero-day worms (for which no known patches exist). Furthermore, our approach does not depend on a centralized update repository, which can be the target of a concerted attack similar to the Blaster worm. Finally, our approach can also be used to protect against lower intensity attacks, such as intrusion (``hack-in&#039;&#039;) attempts. To experimentally evaluate the efficacy of our approach, we use our prototype implementation to test a number of applications with known vulnerabilities. Our preliminary results indicate a success rate of 82\%, and a maximum repair time of 8.5 seconds.</td>

To accommodate nonlinear temporal activity, each	individual leaf process is modeled as a dynamical system	containing discrete and/or continuous hidden states with	discrete and/or Gaussian emissions. Subsequent, higher level	parent processes act like hidden Markov models that mediate	the interaction between leaf processes or between other parent	processes in the hierarchy. Aggregator chains are parents of	the child processes the combine and mediate, yielding a	compact overall parameterization. We provide tractable	inference and learning algorithms for arbitrary DSTs	topologies via structured mean field. Experiments are shown	for real trajectory data of tracked American football plays	where a DST tracks players as dynamical systems mediated by	their team processes mediated in turn by a top-level game	process.</td>

Contrary to the ad hoc	manner in which contemporary survivable systems are	built--using isolated, independent security mechanisms such as	firewalls, intrusion detection systems and software	sandboxes--SABER integrates several different technologies in	an attempt to provide a unified framework for responding to	the wide range of attacks malicious insiders and outsiders can	launch.
This coordinated multi-layer approach will be capable of	defending against attacks targeted at various levels of the	network stack, such as congestion-based DoS attacks,	software-based DoS or code-injection attacks, and others. Our	fundamental insight is that while multiple lines of defense	are useful, most conventional, uncoordinated approaches fail	to exploit the full range of available responses to	incidents. By coordinating the response, the ability to	survive even in the face of successful security breaches	increases substantially.
We discuss the key components of SABER, how they will be	integrated together, and how we can leverage on the promising	results of the individual components to improve survivability	in a variety of coordinated attack scenarios. SABER is	currently in the prototyping stages, with several interesting	open research topics.</td>

These mechanisms require lower level effectors somehow attached to the target system, so we briefly sketch one such facility (elaborated elsewhere). Our main contribution is the model, architecture, and implementation of Workflakes, the decentralized process engine we use to tailor, control, coordinate, etc. a cohort of such effectors. We have validated the Workflakes approach with case studies in several application domains.

                    <td class="col-md-2">New vision applications have been made possible and old ones improved through the creation and design of novel catadioptric systems. Critical to the design of catadioptric imaging is determining the shape of one or more mirrors in the system. Almost all the previously designed mirrors for catadioptric systems used case specific tools and considerable effort on the part of the designer. Recently some new general methods have been proposed to automate the design process. However, all the methods presented so far determine the mirror shape by optimizing its geometric properties, such as surface normal orientations. A more principled approach is to determine a mirror that reduces image errors.
In this paper we present a method for finding mirror shapes which meet user determined specifications while minimizing image error. We accomplish this by deriving a first order approximation of the image error. This permits us to compute the mirror shape using a linear approach that provides good results efficiently while avoiding the numerical problems associated with non-linear optimization. Since the design of mirrors can also be applied to projection systems, we also provide a method to approximate projection errors in the scene. We demonstrate our approach on various catadioptric systems and show our approach to provide much more accurate imaging characteristics. In some cases we achieved reduction in image error up to 80 percent.</td>

This task, called Content Selection, is quite domain	dependent, requiring considerable re-engineering to transport	the system from one scenario to another. In (Duboue and	McKeown, 2003), we presented a method to acquire content	selection rules automatically from a corpus of text and	associated semantics. Our proposed technique was evaluated by	comparing its output with information selected by human	authors in unseen texts, where we were able to filter half the	input data set without loss of recall.

Unlike many other schedulers, a low-overhead GR3	implementation is easy to build using simple data structures.	We have implemented GR3 in Linux and measured its performance	against other schedulers commonly used in research and	practice, including the standard Linux scheduler, Weighted	Fair Queueing, Virtual-Time Round-Robin, and Smoothed	Round-Robin. Our experimental results demonstrate that GR3	can provide much lower scheduling overhead and better	scheduling accuracy in practice than these other approaches	for large numbers of clients.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">A top-k query specifies a set of preferred values	for the attributes of a relation and expects as a result the k	objects that are closest to the given preferences according to	some distance function. In many web applications, the relation	attributes are only available via probes to autonomous	web-accessible sources. Probing these sources sequentially to	process a top-k query is inefficient, since web accesses	exhibit high and variable latency. Fortunately, web sources	can be probed in parallel, and each source can typically	process concurrent requests, although sources may impose some	restrictions on the type and number of probes that they are	willing to accept. These characteristics of web sources	motivate the introduction of parallel top-k query processing	strategies, which are the focus of this paper. We present	efficient techniques that maximize source-access parallelism	to minimize query response time, while satisfying source	access constraints. A thorough experimental evaluation over	both synthetic and real web sources shows that our techniques	can be significantly more efficient than previously proposed	sequential strategies. In addition, we adapt our parallel	algorithms for the alternate optimization goal of minimizing	source load while still exploiting source-access	parallelism.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We propose a new storage model called MBSM	(Multi-resolution Block Storage Model) for laying out tables	on disks. MBSM is intended to speed up operations such as	scans that are typical of data warehouse workloads. Disk	blocks are grouped into ``super-blocks,&#039;&#039; with a single record	stored in a partitioned fashion among the blocks in a	super-block. The intention is that a scan operation that	needs to consult only a small number of attributes can access	just those blocks of each super-block that contain the desired	attributes. To achieve good performance given the physical	characteristics of modern disks, we organize super-blocks on	the disk into fixed-size ``mega-blocks.&#039;&#039; Within a	mega-block, blocks of the same type (from various	super-blocks) are stored contiguously. We describe the	changes needed in a conventional database system to manage	tables using such a disk organization. We demonstrate	experimentally that MBSM outperforms competing approaches such	as NSM (N-ary Storage Model), DSM (Decomposition Storage	Model) and PAX (Partition Attributes Across), for I/O bound	decision-support workloads consisting of scans in which not	all attributes are required. This improved performance comes	at the expense of single-record insert and delete performance;	we quantify the trade-offs involved. Unlike DSM, the cost of	reconstructing a record from its partitions is small. MBSM	stores attributes in a vertically partitioned manner similar	to PAX, and thus shares PAX&#039;s good CPU cache behavior. We	describe methods for mapping attributes to blocks within	super-blocks in order to optimize overall performance, and	show how to tune the super-block and mega-block sizes.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Cooperating processes are increasingly used to	structure modern applications in common client-server	computing environments. This cooperation among processes	often results in dependencies such that a certain process	cannot proceed until other processes finish some tasks.	Despite the popularity of using cooperating processes in	application design, operating systems typically ignore process	dependencies and schedule processes independently. This can	result in poor system performance due to the actual scheduling	behavior contradicting the desired scheduling policy.
To address this problem, we have developed SWAP, a system that	automatically detects process dependencies and accounts for	such dependencies in scheduling. SWAP uses system call	history to determine possible resource dependencies among	processes in an automatic and fully transparent fashion.	Because some dependencies cannot be precisely determined, SWAP	associates confidence levels with dependency information that	are dynamically adjusted using feedback from process blocking	behavior. SWAP can schedule processes using this imprecise	dependency information in a manner that is compatible with	existing scheduling mechanisms and ensures that actual	scheduling behavior corresponds to the desired scheduling	policy in the presence of process dependencies. We have	implemented SWAP in Linux and measured its effectiveness on	microbenchmarks and real applications. Our experiment results	show that SWAP has low overhead and can provide substantial	improvements in system performance in scheduling processes	with dependencies.</td>

In this paper we propose	techniques, based on a notion of projection for XML, which can	be used to drastically reduce memory requirements in XQuery	processors. The main contribution of the paper is a static	analysis technique that can identify at compile time which	parts of the input document are needed to answer an arbitrary	XQuery. We present a loading algorithm that takes the	resulting information to build a projected document, which is	smaller than the original document, and on which the query	yields the same result. We implemented projection in the	Galax XQuery processor. Our experiments show that projection	reduces memory requirements by a factor of 20 on average, and	is effective for a wide variety of queries. In addition,	projection results in some speedup during query evaluation.</td>

In this paper, we	present a general framework of structure recovery for	pushbroom cameras with 6 degree-of-freedom motion. We analyze	the translation and rotation cases using our framework and	demonstrate that several previous results are really special	cases of our result. Using this framework, we also show that	three or more pushbroom cameras can be used to compute scene	structure as well as motion of translation or rotation.

Because of the distributed nature of networks, large-scale information systems are highly vulnerable to negative elements such as intruders and attackers. The types of attack on a system can be diverse and from different sources. Some of the factors contributing to creating an insecure system are the relentless pace of technology, the need for information processing, and the heterogeneity of hardware and software. In addition to these insecurities, the growth and success of e-commerce make networks a desirable target for intruders to steal credit card numbers, bank account balances, and other valuable information.

There has been much literature on dependable/survivable distributed systems; most is concerned with developing new architectures, not adapting pre-existing ones. Additionally, the literature is focused on hardening, security-based defense, as opposed to recovery. For deployed systems, it is often infeasible to completely replace existing infrastructures; what is more pragmatic are ways in which existing distributed systems can be adapted to offer better dependability. In this paper, we outline a general architecture that can easily be retrofitted to legacy workflow systems in order to improve dependability and fault tolerance. We do this by monitoring enactment and replicating partial workflow states as tools for detection, analysis and recovery. We discuss some policies that can guide these mechanisms. Finally, we describe and evaluate our implementation, Survivor, which modified an existing workflow system provided by the Naval Research Lab.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Ensuring the security and integrity of computer systems deployed on the Internet is growing harder. This is especially true in the case of server systems based on open source projects like Linux, Apache, Sendmail, etc. since it is easier for a hacker to get access to the binary format of deployed applications if the source code to the software is publicly accessible. Often, having a binary copy of an application program is enough to help locate security vulnerabilities in the program. In the case of legacy systems where the source code is not available, advanced reverse-engineering and decompilation techniques can be used to construct attacks.
This paper focuses on measures that reduce the effectiveness of hackers at conducting large-scale, distributed attacks. The first line of defense involves additional runtime checks that are able to counteract the majority of hacking attacks. Introducing diversity in deployed systems to severely diminish the probability of propagation to other systems helps to prevent effective attacks like the DDOS attack against the DNS root servers in October 21, 2002.</td>

This can range from pop-up ads to flashy banners to unnecessary images and links scattered around the screen. Extraction of &quot;useful and relevant&quot; content from web pages, has many applications ranging from lightweight environments, like cell phone and PDA browsing, to speech rendering for the visually impaired, to text summarization Most approaches to removing the clutter or making the content more readable involves either changing the size of the font or simply removing certain HTML-denoted components like images, thus taking away from the webpage&#039;s inherent look and feel. Unlike Content Reformatting, which aims to reproduce the entire webpage in a more convenient form, our solution directly addresses Content Extraction. We have developed a framework that employs an easily extensible set of techniques that incorporate advantages of previous work on content extraction while limiting the disadvantages. Our key insight is to work with the Document Object Model tree (after parsing and correcting the HTML), rather than with raw HTML markup. We have implemented our approach in a publicly available Web proxy that anyone can use to extract content from HTML web pages for their own purposes.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">There is a widespread interest in switching architectures that can scale in capacity with increasing interface transmission rates and higher port counts. Furthermore, packet switches that provide Quality of Service (QoS), such as bandwidth and delay guarantees, to the served user traffic are also highly desired. This report addresses the issue of constructing a high-capacity QoS-capable, multi-module switching node.
Output queued switches provide the best performance in terms of throughput as well as QoS but do not scale. Input queued switches, on the other hand, require complex arbitration procedures to achieve the same level of performance. We enumerate the design constraints in the construction of a packet switch and present several approaches to build a system composed of lower-capacity memory and space elements, and analyze their performance. Towards this goal, we establish a new taxonomy for a class of switches, which we call Buffered Clos switches, and present a formal framework for optimal packet switching performance, in terms of both throughput and QoS.
Within the taxonomy, we augment the existing combined input-output queueing (CIOQ) systems with Aggregation and Pipelining techniques. Furthermore, we present the design and analysis of a novel parallel packet switch architecture. For the items in the taxonomy, we present algorithms that provide optimal throughput and QoS, in accordance with the above performance framework. While some of the presented ideas are still in the investigative stage, we believe that the current state of the work, especially the formal treatment of switching, will be beneficial to the ongoing research in the field.</td>

Examples of such problems include integration, approximation, ordinary and partial differential equations, integral equations, and the solution of nonlinear problems such as root-finding and optimization. In this talk, we give a brief overview of IBC. We focus mainly on the integration problem (which is a simple, yet important, problem that can be used to illustrate the main ideas of IBC) and the approximation problem (which will be of most interest to specialists in learning theory). One important issue that we discuss is the ``curse of dimension&#039;&#039;---the depressing fact that the worst case complexity of many problems depends exponentially on dimension, rendering them intractable. We explore IBC-based techniques for vanquishing the curse of dimension. In particular, we find that randomization beats intractability for the integration problem but not for the approximation problem; on the other hand, both these problems are tractable in the average case setting under a Wiener sheet measure.</td>

The question addressed here is how to retrofit existing systems with self-healing, adaptation and/or self management capabilities. The problem is obviously intensified for &quot;systems of systems&quot; composed of components, whether new or legacy, that may have been developed by different vendors, mixing and matching COTS and &quot;open source&quot; components. This system composition model is expected to be increasingly common in high performance computing. The usual approach is to train technicians to understand the complexities of these components and their connections, including performance tuning parameters, so that they can then manually monitor and reconfigure the system as needed. We envision instead attaching a &quot;standard&quot; feedback loop infrastructure to existing distributed systems for the purposes of continual monitoring and dynamically adapting their activities and performance. (This approach can also be applied to &quot;new&quot; systems, as an alternative to &quot;building in&quot; adaptation facilities, but we do not address that here.) Our proposed infrastructure consists of multiple layers with the objectives of probing, measuring and reporting of activity and state within the execution of the legacy system among its components and connectors; gauging, analysis and interpretation of the reported events; and possible feedback to focus the probes and gauges to drill deeper, or when necessary - direct but automatic reconfiguration of the running system.</td>

These mechanisms require lower-level actuators or effectors somehow attached to the target system, so we briefly sketch one such facility (elaborated elsewhere). The core of the paper is the model, architecture, and implementation of Workflakes, the decentralized process engine we use to tailor, control, coordinate, respond to contingencies, etc. regarding a cohort of such actuators. We have validated our approach and the Workflakes prototype in several case studies, related to different application domains. Due to space restrictions we concentrate primarily on one case study, elaborate with some details a second, and only sketch others.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">A query to a web search engine usually consists of a list of keywords, to which the search engine responds with the best or &quot;top&quot; k pages for the query. This top-k query model is prevalent over multimedia collections in general, but also over plain relational data for certain applications. For example, consider a relation with information on available restaurants, including their location, price range for one diner, and overall food rating. A user who queries such a relation might simply specify the user&#039;s location and target price range, and expect in return the best 10 restaurants in terms of some combination of proximity to the user, closeness of match to the target price range, and overall food rating. Processing such top-k queries efficiently is challenging for a number of reasons. One critical such reason is that, in many web applications, the relation attributes might not be available other than through external web-accessible form interfaces, which we will have to query repeatedly for a potentially large set of candidate objects. In this paper, we study how to process top-k queries efficiently in this setting, where the attributes for which users specify target values might be handled by external, autonomous sources with a variety of access interfaces. We present several new algorithms for processing such queries, and adapt existing techniques to our scenario as well. We also study the execution time of our algorithms analytically and present experimental results using both synthetic and real web-accessible data.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Repositories of multimedia objects having multiple types of attributes (e.g., image, text) are becoming increasingly common. A query on these attributes will typically request not just a set of objects, as in the traditional relational query model (filtering), but also a grade of match associated with each object, which indicates how well the object matches the selection condition (ranking). Furthermore, unlike in the relational model, users may just want the k top-ranked objects for their selection queries, for a relatively small k. In addition to the differences in the query model, another peculiarity of multimedia repositories is that they may allow access to the attributes of each object only through indexes. In this paper, we investigate how to optimize the processing of top-k selection queries over multimedia repositories. The access characteristics of the repositories and the above query model lead to novel issues in query optimization. In particular, the choice of the indexes used to search the repository strongly influences the cost of processing the filtering condition. We define an execution space that is search-minimal, i.e., the set of indexes searched is minimal. Although the general problem of picking an optimal plan in the search-minimal execution space is NP-hard, we present an efficient algorithm that solves the problem optimally when the predicates in the query are independent. We also show that the problem of optimizing top-k selection queries can be viewed, in many cases, as that of evaluating more traditional selection conditions. Thus, both problems can be viewed together as an extended filtering problem to which techniques of query processing and optimization may be adapted.</td>

                      A Flexible and Efficient Protocol for Multi-Scope Service Registry Replication

                    <td class="col-md-2">Service registries play an important role in service discovery systems by accepting service registrations and answering service queries; they can serve a wide range of purposes, such as membership services, lookup services, and search services. To provide fault tolerant, and enhance scalability, availability and performance, service registries often need to be replicated. In this paper, we present Swift (Selective anti-entropy WIth FasT update propagation), a flexible and efficient protocol for multi-scope service registry replication. As consistency is a less of concern compared with availability in service registry replication, we choose to build Swift on top of anti-entropy to support high availability replication. Swift makes two contributions as follows. First, it defines a more general and flexible form of anti-entropy called selective anti-entropy, which extends the applicability of anti-entropy from full replication to partial replication by selectively reconciling inconsistent states between two replicas, and improves anti-entropy efficiency by fine controlling update propagation within each subset. Selective anti-entropy is the first that we are aware of in using anti-entropy to support generic partial replication. Secondly, Swift integrates service registry overlay networks with selective anti-entropy. Different topologies, such as full mesh and spanning tree, can be used for constructing service registry overlay networks. These overlay networks are used to propagate new updates quickly so as to minimize inconsistency among replicas. We have implemented Swift for replicating multi-scope Directory Agents in the Service Location Protocol. Our experience shows that Swift is flexible, efficient, and lightweight.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We introduce elastic quotas, a disk space management technique that makes disk space an elastic resource like CPU and memory. Elastic quotas allow all users to use unlimited amounts of available disk space while still providing system administrators the ability to control how the disk space is allocated among users. Elastic quotas maintain existing persistent file semantics while supporting user-controlled policies for removing files when the file system becomes too full. We have implemented an elastic quota system in Solaris and measured its performance. The system is simple to implement, requires no kernel modifications, and is compatible with existing disk space management methods. Our results show that elastic quotas are an effective, low-overhead solution for flexible file system management.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Many valuable text databases on the web have non-crawlable contents that are &quot;hidden&quot; behind search interfaces. Metasearchers are helpful tools for searching over many such databases at once through a unified query interface. A critical task for a metasearcher to process a query e??ciently and eRectively is the selection of the most promising databases for the query, a task that typically relies on statistical summaries of the database contents. Unfortunately, web accessible text databases do not generally export content summaries. In this paper, we present an algorithm to derive content summaries from &quot;uncooperative&quot; databases by using &quot;focused query probes,&quot; which adaptively zoom in on and extract documents that are representative of the topic coverage of the databases. Our content summaries are the first to include absolute document frequency estimates for the database words. We also present a novel database selection algorithm that exploits both the extracted content summaries and a hierarchical classification of the databases, automatically derived during probing, to compensate for potentially incomplete content summaries. Finally, we evaluate our techniques thoroughly using a variety of databases, including 50 real web-accessible text databases. Our experiments indicate that our new content-summary construction technique is effcient and produces more accurate summaries than those from previously proposed strategies. Also, our hierarchical database selection algorithm exhibits significantly higher precision than its flat counterparts.</td>

Scalability and the capacity for distributed control have unfortunately not extended well to resource access control policies and mechanisms. Yet management of security is becoming an increasingly challenging problem, in no small part due to scaling up of measures such as number of users, protocols, applications, network elements, topological constraints, and functionality expectations.
In this paper we discuss scalability challenges for traditional access control mechanisms and present a set of fundamental requirements for authorization services in large scale networks. We show why existing mechanisms fail to meet these requirements, and investigate the current design options for a scalable access control architecture.
We argue that the key design options to achieve scalability are the choice of the representation of access control policy, the distribution mechanism for policy and the choice of access rights revocation scheme.</td>

The routing algorithms considered are based on methods originally defined for peer-to-peer services. A model was developed for the overlay network which allowed altering the routing algorithm, method for selection of special purpose nodes and the underlying ISP structure. The model was used to assess the impact of specific routing algorithms and selection methods on latency and path length. The implications of utilizing a specific method for node selection on the probability of a successful DDoS attack is briefly discussed.</td>

Our goal is to study a signaling protocol that fairly distributes the resources reserved for each DS service between scalable multimedia sessions in a multicast network environment, where scalable sources divide session traffic in hierarchical layers, sending each layer to different multicast groups. We present a signaling protocol called Session-Aware Popularity Resource Allocation (SAPRA) that allows the distribution of DS services resources along sessions path, based upon the receiver population of each session. Simulations show that SAPRA protocol has small bandwidth overhead, is efficient updating the resources allocated to each session and also supplying receivers with reports about the quality level of their session.</td>

This data is often best exploited in structured or relational form, which is suited for sophisticated query processing, for integration with relational databases, and for data mining. Current information extraction techniques extract relations from a text database by examining every document in the database. This exhaustive approach is not practical, or sometimes even feasible, for large databases. In this paper, we develop an efficient query-based technique to identify documents that are potentially useful for the extraction of a target relation. We start by sampling the database to characterize the documents from which an information extraction system manages to extract relevant tuples. Then, we apply machine learning and information retrieval techniques to derive queries likely to match additional useful documents in the database. Finally, we issue these queries to the database to retrieve documents from which the information extraction system can extract the final relation. Our technique requires that databases support only a minimal boolean query interface, and is independent of the choice of the underlying information extraction system. We report a thorough experimental evaluation over more than one million documents that shows that we significantly improve the efficiency of the extraction process by focusing only on promising documents. Our proposed technique could be used to query a standard web search engine, hence providing a building block for efficient information extraction over the web at large.</td>

This paper concentrates on how we coordinate and actuate the potentially multi-part adaptation, operating externally to the target systems, that is, without requiring any a priori built-in adaptation facilities on the part of said target systems. The actual changes are performed on the fly onto the target by communities of mobile software agents, coordinated by a decentralized process engine. These changes can be coarse-grained, such as replacing entire components or rearranging the connections among components, or fine-grained, such as changing the operational parameters, internal state and functioning logic of individual components. We discuss our successful experience using our approach in dynamic adaptation of a large-scale commercial application, which requires both coarse and fine grained modifications.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">XML employs a tree-structured data model, and, naturally, XML queries specify patterns of selection predicates on multiple elements related by a tree structure. Finding all occurrences of such a twig pattern in an XML database is a core operation for XML query processing. Prior work has typically decomposed the twig pattern into binary structural (parent-child and ancestor-descendant) relationships, and twig matching is achieved by: (i)~using structural join algorithms to match the binary relationships against the XML database, and (ii)~stitching together these basic matches. A limitation of this approach for matching twig patterns is that intermediate result sizes can get large, even when the input and output sizes are more manageable.
In this paper, we propose a novel holistic twig join algorithm, TwigStack, for matching an XML query twig pattern. Our technique uses a chain of linked stacks to compactly represent partial results to root-to-leaf query paths, which are then composed to obtain matches for the twig pattern. When the twig pattern uses only ancestor-descendant relationships between elements, TwigStack is I/O and CPU optimal among all sequential algorithms that read the entire input: it is linear in the sum of sizes of the input lists and the final result list, but independent of the sizes of intermediate results. We then show how to use (a modification of) B-trees, along with TwigStack, to match query twig patterns in sub-linear time. Finally, we complement our analysis with experimental results on a range of real and synthetic data, and query twig patterns.</td>

Peers can be either mobile or stationary. We focus on three different facets of cooperation, namely, data sharing, message relaying and network connection sharing. 7DS enables wireless devices to discover, disseminate, relay information among each other to increase the data access. We evaluate via extensive simulations the effectiveness of our system for data dissemination and message relaying among mobile devices with a large number of user mobility scenarios. We model several general data dissemination approaches and investigate the effect of the wireless coverage range, 7DS host density, and cooperation strategy among the mobile hosts as a function of time. We also present a power conservation mechanism that is beneficial, since it increases the power savings, without degrading the data dissemination. Using theory from random walks, random environments and diffusion of controlled processes, we model one of these data dissemination schemes and show that the analysis confirms the simulation results for this scheme.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Virtual Network Address Translation (VNAT) is a novel architecture that allows transparent migration of end-to-end live network connections associated with various computation units. Such computation units can be either a single process, or a group of processes of an application, or an entire host. VNAT virtualizes network connections perceived by transport protocols so that identification of network connections is decoupled from stationary hosts. Such virtual connections are then remapped into physical connections to be carried on the physical network using network address translation. VNAT requires no modification to existing applications, operating systems, or protocol stacks. Furthermore, it is fully compatible with the existing communication infrastructure; virtual and normal connections can coexist without interfering each other. VNAT functions entirely within end systems and requires no third party proxies. We have implemented a VNAT prototype with the Linux 2.4 kernel and demonstrated its functionality on a wide range of popular real-world network applications. Our performance results show that VNAT has essentially no overhead except when connections are migrated, in which case the overhead of our Linux prototype is less than 7 percent.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">SDARTS is a protocol and toolkit designed to facilitate metasearching. SDARTS combines two complementary existing protocols, SDLIP and STARTS, to define a uniform interface that collections should support for searching and exporting metasearch-related metadata. SDARTS also includes a toolkit with wrappers that are easily customized to make both local and remote document collections SDARTS-compliant. This paper describes two significant ways in which we have extended the SDARTS toolkit. First, we have added a tool that automatically builds rich content summaries for remote web collections by probing the collections with appropriate queries. These content summaries can then be used by a metasearcher to select over which collections to evaluate a given query. Second, we have enhanced the SDARTS toolkit so that all SDARTS-compliant collections export their metadata under the emerging Open Archives Initiative (OAI) protocol. Conversely, the SDARTS toolkit now also allows all OAI-compliant collections to be made SDARTS-compliant with minimal effort. As a result, we implemented a bridge between SDARTS and OAI, which will facilitate easy interoperability among a potentially large number of collections. The SDARTS toolkit, with all related documentation and source code, is publicly available at http://sdarts.cs.columbia.edu.</td>

                      The Design of High-Throughput Asynchronous Pipelines

                    <td class="col-md-2">Clocked or synchronous design has traditionally been used for nearly all digital systems. However, it is now facing significant challenges as clock rates reach several GigaHertz, chip sizes increase, and the demand for low power and modular design become paramount. An alternative paradigm is clockless or asynchronous design, which has several potential advantages towards meeting these challenges.
This thesis focuses on the design of very high-speed asynchronous systems. A more specific focus of this thesis is on high-throughput asynchronous pipelines, since pipelining is at the heart of most high-performance systems.
This thesis contributes four new asynchronous pipeline styles: &quot;lookahead,&quot; &quot;high-capacity,&quot; &quot;MOUSETRAP&quot; and &quot;dynamic GasP&quot; pipelines. The styles differ from each other in many aspects, such as protocols, storage capacity, implementation style, and timing assumptions. The new styles are capable of multi-GigaHertz throughputs in today&#039;s silicon technology (e.g., 0.13-0.18 micron), yet each style has a simple implementation. High throughputs are obtained through efficient pipelining of systems at a fine granularity, though the pipeline styles are also useful for coarser-grain applications.
The basic pipeline styles are extended to address several issues that arise in practice while designing real-world systems. In particular, the styles are generalized to handle a greater variety of architectures (e.g., datapaths with forks and joins), and to robustly interface with arbitrary-speed environments.
Finally, the approaches of this thesis are validated by designing and fabricating real VLSI subsystems, including: simple FIFO&#039;s, pipelined adders, and an experimental digital FIR filter chip. All chips were tested to be fully functional; throughputs of over 2.4 GHz for the FIFO&#039;s, and up to 1.3 GHz for the FIR filter, were obtained in an IBM 0.18 micron technology.</td>

In particular, the memo explores issues of error resiliency and recovery. In particular, the paper considers two questions. First, given N consecutive frame erasures (due to packet losses), how long does the decoder take to resynchronize its state with the encoder? What is the strength of the resulting error signal, both in terms of objective and subjective measures? The second issue explores which particular factors contribute to the strength of the error signal: the distortion of the speech due to the incorrect concealment of the erasures, or the subsequent distortion due to the loss of state synchronization, even though correct packets are being received. Both objective and subjective measures are used to characterize the importance of each of these two factors.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We study the complexity of Fredholm problems $(I-T_k)u=f$ of the second kind on the $I^d=[0,1]^d$. Previous work on the complexity of this problem has assumed either that we had complete information about the kernel~$k$ or that the kernel~$k$ and the right-hand side~$f$ had the same smoothness; moreover, this information is usually exact. In this paper, we suppose that $f\in W^{r,p}(I^d)$ and $k\in W^{s,p}(I^d)$. We also assume that $\delta$-noisy standard information is available. We find that the $n$th minimal error is $\Theta(n^{-\mu}+\delta)$, where $\mu = \min\{r/d, s/(2d)\}$, and that a noisy modified finite element method (MFEM) has nearly minimal error. This noisy modified FEM can be efficiently implemented using multigrid techniques. Using these results, we find tight bounds on the $\varepsilon$-complexity for this problem, said bounds depending on the cost~$c(\delta)$ of calculating a $\delta$-noisy information value. As an example, if the cost of a $\delta$-noisy evaluation is proportional to $\delta^{-t}$, then the $\varepsilon$-complexity is roughly $(1/\varepsilon)^{1/\mu+t}$.</td>

                      Surface Approximation May Be Easier Than Surface Integration

                    <td class="col-md-2">The approximation and integration problems consist of finding an approximation to a function~$f$ or its integral over some fixed domain~$\Sigma$. For the classical version of these problems, we have partial information about the functions~$f$ and complete information about the domain~$\Sigma$; for example, $\Sigma$ might be a cube or ball in~$\mathbb R^d$. When this holds, it is generally the case that integration is not harder than approximation; moreover, integration can be much easier than approximation. What happens if we have partial information about~$\Sigma$? This paper studies the surface approximation and surface integration problems, in which $\Sigma=\Sigma_g$ for functions~$g$. More specifically, our functions~$f$ are $r$~times continuously differentiable scalar functions of $l$~variables, and $g$ are $s$~times continuously differentiable injective functions of~$d$ variables with $l$~components. Error for the surface approximation problem is measured in the $L_q$-sense. Our problems are well-defined, provided that $d\le l$, $r\ge 0$, and $s\ge 1$. Information consists of function evaluations of~$f$ and~$g$. We show that the $\varepsilon$-complexity of surface approximation is proportional to $(1/\varepsilon)^{1/\mu}$ with $\mu=\mrs/d$. We also show that if $s\ge 2$, then the $\varepsilon$-complexity of surface integration is proportional to $(1/\varepsilon)^{1/\nu}$ with $$\nu=\min\left\{ \frac{r}{d},\frac{s-\delta_{s,1}(1-\delta_{d,l})}{\min\{d,l-1\}}\right\}.$$ (This bound holds as well for several subcases of $s=1$; we conjecture that it holds for all $r\ge0$, $s\ge1$, and $d\le l$.) Using these results, we determine when surface approximation is easier than, as easy as, or harder than, surface integration; all three possibilities can happen. In particular, we find that if $s=1$ and $d&lt;l$, then $\mu=1/d$ and $\nu=0$, so that surface integration is unsolvable and surface approximation is solvable; this is an extreme case for which surface approximation is easier than surface integration.</td>

Metasearchers are helpful tools for searching over many such databases at once through a unified query interface. A critical task for a metasearcher to process a query efficiently and effectively is the selection of the most promising databases for the query, a task that typically relies on statistical summaries of the database contents. Unfortunately, web-accessible text databases do not generally export content summaries. In this paper, we present an algorithm to derive content summaries from ``uncooperative&#039;&#039; databases by using ``focused query probes,&#039;&#039; which adaptively zoom in on and extract documents that are representative of the topic coverage of the databases. The content summaries that result from this algorithm are efficient to derive and more accurate than those from previously proposed probing techniques for content-summary extraction. We also present a novel database selection algorithm that exploits both the extracted content summaries and a hierarchical classification of the databases, automatically derived during probing, to produce accurate results even for imperfect content summaries. Finally, we evaluate our techniques thoroughly using a variety of databases, including 50 real web-accessible text databases.</td>

The techniques address compiling a wide variety of languages, ranging from dataflow to Petri nets. Each uses a different technique, to some degree chosen to match the semantics of concurrent language. Each technique is considered to consist of a partial evaluator operating on an interpreter.

                    <td class="col-md-2">One key element in understanding the molecular machinery of the cell is to understand the meaning, or function, of each protein encoded in the genome. A very successful means of inferring the function of a previously unannotated protein is via sequence similarity with one or more proteins whose functions are already known. Currently, one of the most powerful such homology detection methods is the SVM-Fisher method of Jaakkola, Diekhans and Haussler (ISMB 2000). This method combines a generative, profile hidden Markov model (HMM) with a discriminative classification algorithm known as a support vector machine (SVM). The current work presents an alternative method for SVM-based protein classification. The method, SVM-pairwise, uses a pairwise sequence similarity algorithm such as Smith-Waterman in place of the HMM in the SVM-Fisher method. The resulting algorithm, when tested on its ability to recognize previously unseen families from the SCOP database, yields significantly better remote protein homology detection than SVM-Fisher, profile HMMs and PSI-BLAST.</td>

Two submodels of ActEvents are proposed: SmartEvents, which are XML-structured events containing references to their syntactic and semantic models, and Gaugents, which are heavier but more flexible intelligent mobile software agents. This model is presented in light of DARPA&#039;s DASADA program, where ActEvents are used in a larger-scale subsystem, called KX, which supports continual validation of distributed, component-based systems. ActEvents are emitted by probes in this architecture, and propagated to gauges, where &quot;measurements&quot; of the raw data associated with probes are made, thereby continually determining updated target-system properties. ActEvents are also proposed as solutions for a number of other applications, including a distributed collaborative virtual environment (CVE) known as CHIME.</td>

QProber can use a variety of types of classifiers to generate the probes. To classify a database, QProber does not retrieve or inspect any documents or pages from the database, but rather just exploits the number of matches that each query probe generates at the database in question. We have conducted an extensive experimental evaluation of QProber over collections of real documents, experimenting with different types of document classifiers and retrieval models.

                    <td class="col-md-2">We present a fairness model, called Multi-Layer Utilization Maximal Fairness (MLUM). The motivation of the MLUM model is to accomplish intra-session and inter-session fairness in the presence of multi-rate (multi-layer) multimedia sessions, distributing bandwidth between multicast trees of different sessions, considering the number of receivers in each session, and improving bandwidth efficiency. To accomplish this goal, the model is divided in three components: a fairness definition,a policy and a protocol. The MLUM definition guarantees fairness between receivers in a session and fairness between different sessions, considering the number of receivers in each session. The MLUM policy implements the MLUM definition in multicast aware border routers of Autonomous Systems (AS). It&#039;s functionality is divided in the control plane and the data plane. In the control plane, sessions fair rates are estimated based upon the MLUM fairness definition. In the data plane, a queueing discipline will fairly distribute bandwidth between sessions, considering their fair rates. The MLUM protocol allows the exchange of control information (sessions number of receivers and fair rates) between MLUM policy routers in order to accomplish a fair distribution of bandwidth between concurrent sessions. This paper aim to present the MLUM fairness definition, to describe the MLUM fairness policy control and data plane functionality and to evaluate how the policy data plane can fairly distribute bandwidth. We present some simulations that evaluate the performance of the MLUM policy data plane in different scenarios and that compare its performance to other queueing disciplines. We also briefly describe the MLUM protocol, due to its close relation with of the MLUM policy functionality.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We examine the impact of bursty losses on the perceived quality of packet audio, and investigate the effectiveness various approaches to improve the quality. Because the degree of burstiness depends on the packet interval, we first derive a formula to re-compute the conditional loss probability of a Gilbert loss model when the packet interval changes. We find that FEC works better at a larger packet interval under bursty losses. In our MOS-based (Mean Opinion Score) listening tests, we did not find a consistent trend in MOS when burstiness increases if FEC is not used. That is, In some occasions MOS can be higher with a higher burstiness. With FEC, our results confirms the analytical results that quality is better with a larger packet interval, but $T$ should not be too large to avoid severe penalty on a single packet loss. We also find that low bit-rate redundancy generally produces lower perceived quality than FEC, if the main codec is already a low bit-rate codec. Finally, we compare our MOS results with objective quality estimation algorithms (PESQ, PSQM/PSQM+, MNB and EMBSD). We find PESQ has the best linear correlation with MOS, but the value is still less than commonly cited, implying they cannot be used in isolation to predict MOS.</td>

JAM is anextensible agent-based distributed data mining system that supportsthe remote dispatch and exchange of agents among participating datasites and employs meta-learning techniques to combine the multiplemodels that are learned.

Itanticipates the information needs of users and fulfills them bysearching for information among peers. We evaluate via extensivesimulations the effectiveness of our system in data dissemination formobile devices. We model several general data disseminationapproaches and investigate the effect of the wireless coverage range,network size, query mechanism, cooperation strategy among the mobilehosts and power conservation with a large number of user mobilityscenarios. Using theory from random walks and random environments anddiffusion of controlled processes, we model one of these datadissemination schemes and show that the analysis confirms thesimulation results for this scheme.</td>

For instance, an incorrectly aligned system could cause non-single viewpoints. Also, systems could be designed to specifically deviate from a single viewpoint to trade-off image characteristics such as resolution and field of view. In these cases, a locus of viewpoints is formed, called a caustic. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of the viewpoint loci for catadioptric cameras with conic reflectors. Properties of these viewpoint loci with regard to field of view, resolution and other geometric properties are presented. In addition, we present a simple technique to calibrate such non-single viewpoint catadioptric cameras and estimate their viewpoint loci (caustics) from known camera motion.</td>

We choose the term tweaking to refer to modifications in structure and behavior that can be made to individual components, as well as sets thereof, or the overall target system configuration, such as adding, removing or substituting components, while the system is running and without bringing it down. The goal of software tweaking is manifold: supporting run-time software composition, enforcing adherence to requirements, ensuring uptime and quality of service of mission-critical systems, recovering from and preventing faults, seamless system upgrading, etc. Our approach involves dispatching and coordinating software agents - named Worklets - via a process engine, since successful tweaking of a complex distributed software system often requires the concerted action of multiple agents on multiple components. The software tweaking process must incorporate and decide upon knowledge about the specifications and architecture of the target software, as well as Worklets capabilities. Software tweaking is correlated to a variety of other software processes - such as configuration management, deployment, validation and evolution - and allows to address at run time a number of related concerns that are normally dealt with only at development time.</td>

Here, $g$ is an $s$ times continuously differentiable injection from~$[0,1]^d$ to~$\reals^d$, where we assume that $s\ge1$. Since the problem can be solved exactly when $d=1$, we concentrate our attention on the case $d\ge 2$. This problem is a special case of the surface integration problem we studied previously. Let $\cc$ be the cost of one function evaluation. The results of our previous work might suggest that the $\varepsilon$-complexity of volume calculation should be proportional to $\cc(1/\varepsilon)^{d/s}$ when $s\ge 2$. However, using integration by parts to reduce the dimension, we show that if $s\ge 2$, then the complexity is proportional to $\cc(1/\varepsilon)^{(d-1)/s}$. Next, we consider the case $s=1$, which is the minimal smoothness for which the volume problem is well-defined. We show that when $s=1$, an $\varepsilon$-approximation can be computed with cost proportional to at most $\cc(1/\varepsilon)^{(d-1)d/2}$. Since a lower bound proportional to $\cc(1/\varepsilon)^{d-1}$ holds when $s=1$, it follows that the complexity in the minimal smoothness case is proportional to $\cc(1/\varepsilon)$ when $d=2$, and that there is a gap between the lower and upper bounds when $d\ge 3$.</td>

However, previous approaches are limited in the functionality they provide. In particular, they do not support size-changing algorithms, which are important and useful for many applications, such as compression and security. We propose fast index files, a technique for efficient support of size-changing algorithms in stackable file systems. Fast index files provide a page mapping between file system layers in a way that can be used with any size-changing algorithm. Index files are designed to be recoverable if lost and add less than 0.1\% disk space overhead. We have implemented fast indexing using portable stackable templates, and we have used this system to build several example file systems with size-changing algorithms. We demonstrate that fast index files have very low overhead for typical workloads, only 2.3\% over other stacked file systems. Our system can deliver much better performance on size-changing algorithms than user-level applications, as much as five times faster.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Thin-client computing offers the promise of easier-to-maintain computational services with reduced total cost of ownership. The recent and growing popularity of thin-client systems makes it important to develop techniques for analyzing and comparing their performance, to assess the general feasibility of the thin-client computing model, and to determine the factors that govern the performance of these architectures. To assess the viability of the thin-client computing model, we measured the performance of five popular thin-client platforms running over a wide range of network access bandwidths. Our results show that current thin-client solutions generally work well in a LAN environment, but their performance degrades significantly when they are used in today&#039;s broadband environments. We also find that the efficiency of the thin-client protocols varies widely. In some cases, the efficiency of the thin client protocol for web applications is within a factor of two of standard web protocols, while others are 30 times more inefficient. We analyze the differences in the various approaches and explain the impact of the underlying remote display protocols on overall performance.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">In many applications, users specify target valuesfor the attributes of a relation, and expect in return the k tuplesthat best match these values. Traditional RDBMSs do not process these``top-k queries&#039;&#039; efficiently. In our previous work, we outlined afamily of strategies to map a top-k query into a traditional selectionquery that a RDBMS can process efficiently. The goal of such mappingstrategies is to get all needed tuples (but minimize the number ofretrieved tuples) and thus avoid ``restarts&#039;&#039; to get additionaltuples. Unfortunately, no single mapping strategy performedconsistently the best under all data distributions. In this paper, wedevelop a novel mapping technique that leverages information about thedata distribution and adapts itself to the local characteristics ofthe data and the histograms available to do the mapping. We alsoreport the first experimental evaluation of the new and old mappingstrategies over a real RDBMS, namely over Microsoft&#039;s SQL Server7.0. The experiments show that our new techniques are robust andsignificantly more efficient than previously known strategiesrequiring at least one sequential scan of the data sets.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Recent studies take two different approaches to admission control.Some argue that due scalability limitations, using a signaling protocol to setup reservations is too costly and CPU-intensive for routers. Instead, endusers should apply various end-to-end measurement-based mechanisms to runadmission control. Several other proposals have recommended to reduce thenumber of reservations in the network by using aggregation algorithms, and,thus, reduce the number of signaling messages and states.
We study the signaling cost factors, propose several solutions that achievegood performance with reduced processing cost, and evaluate an implementationof a lightweight signaling protocol that incorporates these solutions. First,we identify some the protocol design issues that determine protocol complexityand efficiency, namely the choice of a two-pass vs. one-pass reservationmodel, partial reservation, and the effect of reservation fragmentation. Wealso explore several design options that can speed up reservation setup andquickly recover from reservation fragmentation. Based on the conclusion ofthese studies, we developed a lightweight signaling protocol that can achievegood performance with low processing cost. We also show that with carefulimplementation and by using some of basic hashing techniques to manage flowstates, we can support up to 10,000 flow setups per second (or about 300,000active flows) on a commodity 700 MHz Pentium PC.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Distributed workflow supports collaborative processes composed ofactivities, in which the synchronization and coordination of the activities andthe people having a part in them (the stakeholders of the process) is anessential characteristic. Workflow is based on the concept of a process model,describing the process to be followed, and on facilities (collectively termedthe process enactment engine) for supporting and guiding the work ofstakeholders according to that model. Distributed workflow technology nowadaysprovides many of the necessary paradigms, techniques and tools to support themanagement of complex, dynamic and decentralized business practices, theirstakeholders, and their processes. There are a number of dimensions concurringto workflow distribution, which interact - and sometimes conflict - with oneother in various, complex ways, such as distribution of the workflowinformation, the workflow actors, tools employed to carry out the work, and thework itself Complete decentralization of WF along all of its distributiondimensions is still a challenge. On the other hand approaches and techniquesthat have been established for and have become typical of distributed workflowshow great potential towards the coordination of various kinds of distributedsoftware systems, which require the execution of some kind of process: twoimportant domains are the run-time monitoring and control of functional andnon-functional properties of the components of a distributed system, and thedynamically determined cooperation within a group of software agents towardssome common goal. This proposal intends to investigate the characteristics ofthose software coordination problems and how they can be tackled withdistributed workflow models and techniques. We intend to carry out ourinvestigation in the light of a case study directed towards process-awareprovision of multimedia services and information to groups of dispersed userscarrying out teamwork, including the automated workflow-based management of anadvanced architecture for broadcasting and streaming video and audio, on thebasis of available network and system resources. The case study can be alsoseen as a particular example within a more generic distributed system scenario,i.e. the continual validation of generic distributed applications. The scaleof distribution is that of global dispersion of processes, software components,stakeholders, and data. Thus, we are going to experiment with a set oftechniques and mechanisms, which address those aspects at the global networkingscale, and whose integration within a globally decentralized workflowmanagement system will help reconciling the various distributed dimensions ofworkflow, as well as resolving diverse distributed coordination problems.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Datacubes compute aggregates of a set of database records at a variety of different granularities. For large datasets with many dimensions, the complete datacube may be very large. In order to support on-line access to datacube results, one would like to perform some precomputation to enhance query performance.
Existing schemes materialize selected datacube tuples on disk, choosing the most beneficial cuboids (i.e., combinations of dimensions) to materialize given a space limit. However, in the context of a data-warehouse receiving frequent ``append&#039;&#039; updates to the database, the cost of keeping these disk-resident cuboids up-to-date can be high.
In this paper, we propose a main memory based framework which provides rapid response to queries and requires considerably less maintenance cost than a disk based scheme in an append-only environment. We materialize in main memory (a) selected coarse-granularity tuples of the datacube, and (b) all tuples at the finest level of granularity of the cube. Our approach is limited to applications in which the finest granularity tuples of the datacube fit in main memory. We argue that there are important applications that meet this requirement. Further, as main memory sizes grow over the coming years, more and more applications will meet this requirement.
For a given datacube query, we first look among our coarse-granularity tuples to see if we have a direct answer for the query. If so, that answer is returned directly. If not, we use a hash based scheme reminiscent of partial match retrieval to rapidly compute the answer to the query from the finest-level data without having to scan all of the base tuples. Our in-memory data structures allow for rapid updates in response to the appearance of new base data.
We show how to choose which coarse-level tuples to precompute, and how to select partial-match keys to minimize the effects of skew. We present analytical and experimental results demonstrating the benefits of our approach.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">A primary goal in biology is to understand the molecular machinery of the cell. The sequencing projects currently underway provide one view of this machinery. A complementary view is provided by data from DNA microarray hybridization experiments. Synthesizing the information from these disparate types of data requires the development of improved computational techniques. We demonstrate how to apply a machine learning algorithm called support vector machines to a heterogeneous data set consisting of expression data as well as phylogenetic profiles derived from sequence similarity searches against a collection of complete genomes. The two types of data provide accurate pictures of overlapping subsets of the gene functional categories present in the cell. Combining the expression data and phylogenetic profiles within a single learning algorithm frequently yields superior classification performance compared to using either data set alone. However, the improvement is not uniform across functional classes. For the data sets investigated here, 23-element phylogenetic profiles typically provide more information than 79-element expression vectors. Often, adding expression data to the phylogenetic profiles introduces more noise than information. Thus, these two types of data should only be combined when there is evidence that the functional classification of interest is clearly reflected in both data sets.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">As random access memory gets cheaper, it becomes increasingly affordable to build computers with large main memories. In this paper, we consider processing queries within the context of a main memory database system and try to enhance the query execution engine of such a system.
An execution plan is usually represented as an operator tree. Traditional query execution engines evaluate a query by recursively iterating each operator and returning exactly one tuple result for each iteration. This generates a large number of function calls. In a main-memory database system, the cost of a function call is relatively high.
We propose a new evaluation method called power-pipelining. Each operator processes and passes many tuples instead of one tuple each time. We keep the number of matches generated in a join in a local counter array. We reconstitute the run-length encoding of the join result (broken down by input tables) at the end of the join processing or when necessary. We describe an overflow handling mechanism that allows us to always evaluate a query without using too much space. Besides the benefit of reducing the number of function calls, power-pipelining compresses the join result automatically and thus can reduce the transmission cost.
However, power-pipelining may not always outperform the traditional pipelining method when the join selectivity is low. To get the benefit of both techniques, we propose to use them together in an execution engine and let the optimizer choose the preferred execution. We discuss how to incorporate this in a cost-based query optimizer.
We implemented power-pipelining and the reconstitution algorithm in the Columbia main memory database system. We present a performance study of power-pipelining and the traditional pipelining method. We show that the improvement of using power-pipelining can be very significant. As a result, we believe that power-pipelining is a useful and feasible technique and should be incorporated into main memory database query execution engines.</td>

This data is best exploited if available as a relational table that we could use for answering precise queries or for running data mining tasks. Our Snowball system extracts these relations from document collections starting with only a handful of user-provided example tuples. Based on these tuples, Snowball generates patterns that are used, in turn, to find more tuples. In this paper we introduce a new pattern and tuple generation scheme for Snowball, with different strengths and weaknesses than those of our original system. We also show preliminary results on how we can combinethe two versions of Snowball to extract tuples more accurately.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Relatively little attention has been given to understanding the fault recovery characteristics and performance tuning of native IP multicast networks. This paper focuses on the interaction of the component protocols to understand their behavior in network failure and recovery scenarios. We consider a multicast environment based on the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) routing protocol, the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol. Analytical models are presented to describe the interplay of all of these protocols in various multicast channel recovery scenarios. Quantitative results for the recovery time of IP multicast channels are given as references for network configurations, and protocol development. Simulation models are developed using the OPNET simulation tool to measure the fault recovery time and the associated protocol control overhead, and study the influence of important protocol parameters. A testbed with five Cisco routers is configured with PIM, OSPF, and IGMP to measure the multicast channel failure and recovery times for a variety of different link and router failures. In general, the failure recovery is found to be light-weight in terms of control overhead and recovery time. Failure recovery time in a WAN is found to be dominated by the unicast protocol recovery process. Failure recovery in a LAN is more complex, and strongly influenced by protocol interactions and implementation specifics. Suggestions for improvement of the failure recovery time via protocol enhancements, parameter tuning, and network configuration are provided.</td>

We propose a novel strategy to automate the classification of search-only text databases. Our technique starts by training a rule-based document classifier, and then uses the classifier&#039;s rules to generate probing queries. The queries are sent to the text databases, which are then classified based on the number of matches that they produce for each query. We report some initial exploratory experiments that show that our approach is promising to automatically characterize the contents of text databases accessible on the web.</td>

Unfortunately, most current web search engines largely ignore the geographical scope of web resources. In this paper, we introduce techniques for automatically computing the geographical scope of web resources, based on the textual content of the resources, as well as on the geographical distribution of hyperlinks to them.

We propose cost-sensitive machine learning techniques to produce models that are optimized for user-defined cost metrics. We describe an automated approach for generating efficient run-time versions of these models. Empirical experiments in off-line analysis and real-time detection show that our cost-sensitive modeling and deployment techniques are effective in reducing the overall cost of intrusion detection.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Real-time applications such as IP telephony, Internet radio stationsand video conferencing tools require certain levels of QoS (Quality ofService). Because the Internet is still a best-effort network, the QoSof these applications must be measured and monitored in order toprovide feedbacks to applications for rate and/or error control, andto both end-users and service providers. A standardized objectivemeasurement technology makes it possible to compare between serviceproviders in a fair way. We address the problems of packet delay andloss measurement, since they are the major determining factor ofmultimedia quality. We first describe the problems and techniques inobtaining good measurement results. Then, we discuss the modeling andanalysis of delay and loss. Our goal is to establish feasible metricsthat can reliably predict perceived quality. We find that the extendedGilbert model (2-state being a special case) is a suitable loss model,and the inter-loss distance metric is useful in capturing theburstiness between loss runs. For delay, besides the autocorrelationmetric, a conditional cumulative distribution function may beuseful. We apply these models to some of our Internet packet traces,and find that losses are generally bursty, and that delays usuallyhave a strong temporal dependency component. We also find that thefinal loss pattern after applying playout delay adjustment (and FEC ifused) still corresponds well to the extended Gilbert model.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Resource reservation needs to accommodate the rapidly growing size andincreasing service diversity of the Internet. Recently, hierarchicalarchitectures have been proposed that provide domain-level reservation.However, it is not clear that these proposals can set up and maintainreservations in an efficient and scalable fashion.
In this paper, we describe a distributed architecture and protocol,called the Border Gateway Reservation Protocol (BGRP), for inter-domain resource reservation that can scale in terms of messageprocessing load. state storage and bandwidth. Each stub or transitdomain may use its own intra-domain resource reservation protocol. BGRPbuilds a sink tree for each of the stub domains. Each sink treeaggregates bandwidth reservations from all data sources in the network.Since backbone routers only maintain the sink tree information, thetotal number of reservation states at each router scales, in the worstcase, linearly with the number of domains in the Internet.
BGRP relies on differentiated services for data forwarding. As aresult, the number of packet classifier entries is small, not the numberof micro-flows.To reduce the protocol message traffic, routers mayreserve domain bandwidth beyond the current load so that sources canjoin or leave the tree or change their reservation without having tosend messages all the way to the root for every such change. We use``soft state&#039;&#039; to maintain reservations. In contrast to RSVP, refreshmessages are delivered reliably, allowing us to reduce the refreshfrequency.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Stackable file systems promise to ease thedevelopment of file systems. Operating system vendors, however,resist making extensive changes to support stacking, because of theimpact on performance and stability. Existing file system interfacesdiffer from system to system and they support extensibilitypoorly. Consequently, extending file system functionality acrossplatforms is difficult.
We propose a new language, FiST, to describe stackable file systems. FiSTuses operations common to file system interfaces. From a singledescription, FiST&#039;s compiler produces file system modules for multipleplatforms. The generated code handles many kernel details, freeingdevelopers to concentrate on the main issues of their file systems.
This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of FiST. Weextended file system functionality in a portable way without changingexisting kernels. We built several file systems using FiST on Solaris,FreeBSD, and Linux. Our experiences with these examples shows the followingbenefits of FiST: average code size over other stackable file systems isreduced ten times; average development time is reduced seven times;performance overhead of stacking is 1-2\%.</td>

These examples are used to generate extraction patterns,that in turn result in new tuples being extracted from the documentcollection. We build on this idea and present our Snowball system. Snowballintroduces novel strategies for generating patterns and extracting tuples fromplain-text documents. At each iteration of the extraction process, Snowballevaluates the quality of these patterns and tuples without human intervention,In this paper we also develop a scalable evaluation methodology and metrics forour task, and present a thorough experimental evaluation of Snowball andcomparable techniques over a collection of more than 300,000 newspaperdocuments.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The abundance of newswire on the World-Wide Webhas resulted in at least four major problems, which seem to presentthe most interesting challenges to users and researchers alike: size,heterogeneity, change, and conflicting information.
Size: several hundred newspapers and news agencies maintain their Web siteswith thousands of news stories in each.
Heterogeneity: some of the data related to news is in structuredformat (e.g., tables); more exists in semi-structured format (e.g.,Web pages, encyclopedias, textual databases); while the rest of thedata is in textual form (e.g., newswire).
Change: most Web sites and certainly all news sources change on a daily basis.
Disagreement: different sources present conflicting or at least different viewsof the same event.
We have approached the second, third, and fourth of these four problems fromthe point of view of text generation. We have developed a system, {\scsummons}, which when coupled with appropriate information extractiontechnology, generates a specific genre of natural language summaries of aparticular event (which we call briefings) in a restricted domain. Thebriefings are concise, they contain facts from multiple and heterogeneoussources, and incorporate evolving information, highlighting agreements andcontradictions among sources on the same topic.
We have developed novel techniques and algorithms for combining data frommultiple sources at the conceptual level (using natural languageunderstanding), for identifying new information on a given topic; and forpresenting the information in natural language form to the user. We named theframework that we have developed for these problems {\em language reuse andregeneration} (LRR). Its novelty lies in the ability to produce text bycollating together text already written by humans on the Web.
The main features of LRR are: increased robustness through a simplifiedparsing/generation component, leverage on text already written by humans, andfacilities for the inclusion of structured data in computer-generated text.
The present thesis contains an introduction to LRR and its use inmulti-document summarization. We have paid special attention to the techniquesfor producing conceptual summaries of multiple sources, to the creation and useof a LRR-based lexicon for text generation, to a methodology used to identifynew and old information in threads of documents, and to the generation offluent natural language text using all the components above.
The thesis contains evaluations of the different components of {\sc summons} aswell as certain aspects of LRR as a methodology. A review of the relevantliterature is included as a separate chapter.</td>

CHIME derives many of its concepts from Multi-User Domains (MUDs), placing users in a semi-automatically generated 3D virtual world representing the software system. Users interact with project artifacts by &quot;walking around&quot; the virtual world, where they potentially encounter and collaborate with other users&#039; avatars. CHIME aims to support large software development projects, in which team members are often geographically and temporally dispersed, through novel use of virtual environment technology. We describe the mechanisms through which CHIME worlds are populated with project artifacts, as well as our initial experiments with CHIME and our future goals for the system.</td>

MINIMALISTembodies a complete technology-independent synthesis path, withstate-of-the-art exact and heuristic asynchronous synthesis algorithms, e.g.optimal state assignment (CHASM), two-level hazard-free logic minimization(HFMIN, ESPRESSO-HF, and IMPYMIN), and synthesis-for-testability. Unlikeother asynchronous synthesis packages, MINIMALIST also offers many options:literal vs. product optimization, single- vs. multi-output logicminimization, using vs. not using fed-back outputs as state variables, andexploring varied code lengths during state assignment, thus allowing thedesigner to explore trade-offs and select the implementation style whichbest suits the application. MINIMALIST benchmark results demonstrate itsability to produce implementations with an average of 34\% and up to 48\% lessarea, and an average of 11\% and up to 37\% better performance, than the bestexisting package. Our synthesis-for-testability method guarantees 100\%testability under both stuck-at and robust path delay fault models,requiring little or no overhead. MINIMALIST also features both command-lineand graphic user interfaces, and supports extension via well-definedinterfaces for adding new tools. As such, it is easily augmented to form acomplete path to technology-dependent logic.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We present the idea of a polycamera which is defined as a tightlypacked camera cluster. The cluster is arranged so as to minimize theoverlap between adjecent views. The objective of such clusters is tobe able to image a very large field of view without loss ofresolution. Since these clusters do not have a single viewpoint,analysis is provided on the effects of such non-singularities. We alsopresent certain conbfigurations for polycameras which cover varyingfields of view. We would like to minimizze the number of sensorsrequired to capture a given field of view. Therefore we recommend theuse of wide-angle sensors as opposed to traditional long focal lengthsensors. However, such wide-angle sensors tend to have severedistortions which pull points towards the optical center. This paperalso proposes a method for recovering the distortion parameterswithout the use of any calibration objects. Since distortions causestraight lines in the scene to appear as curves in the image, ouralgorithm seeks to find the distortion parameters that would map theimage curves to straight lines. The user selects a small set of pointsalong the image curves. Recovery of the distortion parameters isformulated as the minimization of an objective function which isdesigned to explicitly account for noise in the selected imagepoints. Experimental results are presented for synthetic data withdifferent noise levels as well as for real images. Once calibrated,the image stream from a wide angle camera can be undistorted in realtime using look up tables. Finally, we apply our distortion correctiontechnique to a polycamera made of four wide-angle cameras to create ahigh resolution 360 degree panorama in real-time.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The process of teleoperation can be described as allowing a remote user to control a vehicle by interpretting sensor information captured by the vehicle. One method that is frequently used to implement teleoperation is to provide the user with a real-time video display of a perspective camera mounted on the vehicle. This method limits the remote user to seeing the environment in which is vehicle is present through the fixed viewpoint with which the camera is mounted. Having a fixed viewpoint is extremely limiting and significantly impedes the ability of the remote user to properly navigate. One way to address this problem is to mount the perspective camera on a pan-tilt device. This is rarely done because it is expensive and introduces a significant increase in implementation complexity from both the mechanical and electrical point of view. With the advent of omnidirectional camera technology, there is now a second more attractive alternative. This paper describes the \rover, a remote controlled vehicle constructed in the summer of 1998 to demonstrate the use of omnidirectional camera technology and a virtual reality display for vehicular teleoperation, audio-video surveillance and forward reconnaissance.</td>

This approach not only allows for cooperation in a sharedphysical space, but also addresses tele-collaboration in physicallyseparate but virtually shared spaces. We refer to EMMIE as a hybriduser interface because it combines a variety of different technologiesand techniques, including virtual elements such as 3D widgets, andphysical objects such as tracked displays and inputdevices. See-through head-worn displays overlay the virtualenvironment on the physical environment. Our research prototypeincludes additional 2D and 3D displays, ranging from palm-sized towall-sized, allowing the most appropriate one to be used for any task.Objects can be moved among displays (including acrossdimensionalities) through drag \&amp; drop. In analogy to 2D windowmanagers, we describe a prototype implementation of a shared 3Denvironment manager that is distributed across displays, machines, andoperating systems.

                    <td class="col-md-2">We study the worst case complexity of computing $\varepsilon$-approximations of surface integrals. This problem has two sources of partial information: the integrand~$f$ and the function~$g$ defining the surface. The problem is nonlinear in its dependence on~$g$. Here, $f$ is an $r$~times continuously differentiable scalar function of $l$~variables, and $g$ is an $s$~times continuously differentiable injective function of $d$ variables with $l$~components. We must have $d\le l$ and $s\ge1$ for surface integration to be well-defined. Surface integration is related to the classical integration problem for functions of $d$~variables that are $\min\{r,s-1\}$ times continuously differentiable. This might suggest that the complexity of surface integration should be $\Theta((1/\varepsilon)^{d/\min\{r,s-1\}})$. Indeed, this holds when $d&lt;l$ and $s=1$, in which case the surface integration problem has infinite complexity. However, if $d\le l$ and $s\ge 2$, we prove that the complexity of surface integration is $O((1/\varepsilon)^{d/\min\{r,s\}})$. Furthermore, this bound is sharp whenever $d&lt;l$.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Internet telephony enables a wealth of new servicepossibilities. Traditional telephony services, such as callforwarding, transfer, and 800 number services, can be enhanced byinteraction with email, web, and directory services. Additional mediatypes, like video and interactive chat, can be added as well. One ofthe challenges in providing these services is how to effectivelyprogram them. Programming these services requires decisions regardingwhere the code executes, how it interfaces with the protocols thatdeliver the services, and what level of control the code has. In thispaper, we consider this problem in detail. We develop requirements forprogramming Internet telephony services, and we show that at least twosolutions are required --- one geared for service creation by trustedusers (such as administrators), and one geared for service creation byuntrusted users (such as consumers). We review existing techniques forservice programmability in the Internet and in the telephone network,and extract the best components of both. The result is a CommonGateway Interface (CGI) that allows trusted users to developservices, and the Call Processing Language (CPL) that allows untrustedusers to develop services.</td>

Pinpointing bottlenecks in a network is very helpful incongestion control and performance tuning. Measuring link bandwidthscan help identifying such bottlenecks.

It becomes important to considerasymmetric links, as they are gaining popularity in recentyears. Examples are ADSL lines, Cable modems, Satellite links, and 56Kmodems. In this paper, we present an algorithm that can measure eachhop&#039;s link bandwidth in both directions in an IP network. Therefore,it is trivial to detect asymmetry of a link. We performed severalexperiments to validate our algorithm. We also discuss some factorsthat can adversely affect the precision and/or correctness ofbandwidth measurement, and suggest possible solutions.</td>

First, an architectural optimization for 4-phase systems isintroduced. The goal of the optimization is to increase theperformance of a system by increasing the level of concurrent activityin the sequencing of data processing stages. In particular, three newasynchronous sequencers are designed, which increase the throughputof the system. Existing asynchronous datapaths do not operatecorrectly at this increased level of concurrency: data hazardsmay result. Interlock mechanisms are introduced to insure correctoperation. The technique can also be regarded as a low-poweroptimization: The increased throughput can be traded for a significantreduction in the power consumption of the entire system. SPICEsimulation results show that the new sequencers allow roughly twicethe throughput of non-concurrent sequencers. The simulations also show</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">As random access memory gets cheaper, it becomesincreasingly affordable to build computers with large main memories.We consider decision support workloads within the context of a mainmemory database system, and consider ways to enhance the performanceof query evaluation.
Indexes can potentially speed up a variety of operations in a databasesystem. In our context, we are less concerned about incrementalupdating of the index, since we can rebuild indexes in response tobatch updates relatively quickly. Our primary concerns are the timetaken for a lookup, and the space occupied by the index structure.
We study indexing techniques for main memory, including hash indexes,binary search trees, T-trees, B+-trees, interpolation search, andbinary search on arrays. At one extreme, hash-indexes provide fastlookup but require a lot of space. At another extreme, binary searchon an array requires no additional space beyond the array, butperforms relatively poorly. An analysis of binary search on an arrayshows that it has poor reference locality, leading to many cachemisses and slow lookup times.
Our goal is to provide faster lookup times than binary search bypaying better attention to reference locality and cache behavior,without using substantial extra space. We propose a new indexingtechnique called &quot;Cache-Sensitive Search Trees&quot; (CSS-trees). Ourtechnique stores a directory structure on top of a sorted array. Thedirectory represents a balanced search tree stored itself as an array.Nodes in this search tree are designed to have size matching thecache-line size of the machine. Because we store the tree in an arrayNodes in this search tree are designed to have size matching thecache-line size of the machine. Because we store the tree in an arraystructure, we do not have to store internal-node pointers; child nodescan be found by performing arithmetic on array offsets.
We provide an analytic comparison of the algorithms based on theirtime and space requirements. We have implemented all of thetechniques, and present a performance study on two popular modernmachines. We demonstrate that with a small space overhead, we canreduce the cost of binary search on the array by more than a factor oftwo. We also show that our technique dominates B+-trees, T-trees, andbinary search trees in terms of both space and time. Our performancegraphs show significantly different rankings of algorithms than shownin a 1986 study by Lehman and Carey. The explanation of thedifference is that during the last twelve years, the relative cost ofa cache miss to that of a CPU instruction cycle has increased by twoorders of magnitude. As a result, it is now much more important todesign techniques with good cache behavior.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Datacube queries compute aggregates over databaserelations at a variety of granularities, and they constitute animportant class of decision support queries. Often one wants onlydatacube output tuples whose aggregate value satisfies a certaincondition, such as exceeding a given threshold. For example, onemight ask for all combinations of model, color, and year of cars(including the special value ``ALL&#039;&#039; for each of the dimensions) forwhich the total sales exceeded a given amount of money. Computing a selection over a datacube can naively be done by computingthe entire datacube and checking if the selection condition holds foreach tuple in the result. However, it is often the case thatselections are relatively restrictive, meaning that a lot of workcomputing datacube tuples is ``wasted&#039;&#039; since those tuples don&#039;t satisfythe selection condition. Our approach is to develop algorithms for processing a datacube queryusing the selection condition internally during the computation. Bymaking use of the selection condition within the datacube computation,we can safely prune parts of the computation and end up with a moreefficient computation of the answer. Our first technique, called``specialization&#039;&#039;, uses the fact that a tuple in the datacube does notmeet the given threshold to infer that all finer level aggregatescannot meet the threshold. We propose a scheme of specializationtransformations on the underlying data sets, using properties of theaggregates and threshold functions. Our second technique is called ``generalization&#039;&#039;, and applies in the casewhere the actual value of the aggregate is not needed in the output,but used just to compare with the threshold. Generalization uses thefact that a tuple meets the given threshold to infer that all coarserlevel aggregates also meet the threshold. We also propose a scheme ofgeneralization transformations.
We demonstrate the efficiency of these techniques by implementing themwithin the sparse datacube algorithm of Ross and Srivastava. Wepresent a performance study using synthetic and real-world data sets.Our results indicate substantial performance improvements for querieswith selective conditions.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Software Development Environments (SDE) requiresophisticated database transaction models due to the long-duration,interactive, and cooperative nature of the software engineeringactivities. Such Extended Transaction Models (ETM) have been proposedand implemented by building application-specific databases for theSDEs.
With the development of World Wide Web (WWW), there have been a numberof efforts to build SDEs on top of the WWW. Using web serversas the databases to store the software artifacts provided us with a newchallenge: how to implement the ETMs in such web-based SDEs without requiringthe web servers to be customized specifically according to the applicationdomains of the SDEs.
This paper presents our experiences of integrating transactionservices into web based SDEs. We evolved from the traditional approachof building a transaction management component that operated on top ofa dedicated database to the external transaction server approach. Atransaction server, called JPernLite, was built to operateindependently of the web servers and provide the necessaryextensibility for SDEs to implement their ETMs. The transaction servercan be integrated into the SDE via a number of interfaces, and wediscuss the pros and cons of each alternative in detail.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Concurrency control is one of the key problems in design and implementation of collaborative systems such as hypertext/hypermedia systems, CAD/CAM systems and software development environments. Most existing systems store data in specialized databases with built-in concurrency control policies, usually implemented via locking.
It is desirable to construct such collaborative systems on top of the World Wide Web, but most web servers do not support even conventional transactions, let alone distributed (multi-website) transactions or flexible concurrency control mechanisms oriented towards teamwork - such as event notification, shared locks and fine granularity locks.
We present a transaction server that operates independently of web servers or the collaborative systems, to fill the concurrency control gap. The transaction server by default enforces the conventional atomic transaction model, where sets of operations are performed in an all-or-nothing fashion and isolated from concurrent users. The server can be tailored dynamically to apply more sophisticated concurrency control policies appropriate for collaboration. The transaction server also supports applications employing information resources other than web servers, such as legacy databases, CORBA objects, and other hypermedia systems. Our implementation permits a wide range of system architecture styles.</td>

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocolthat creates, modifies and terminates associations between Internet endsystems, including conferences and point-to-point calls. SIP supportsunicast, mesh and multicast conferences, as well as combinations ofthese modes. SIP implements services such as call forwarding andtransfer, placing calls on hold, camp-on and call queueing by a smallset of call handling primitives. SIP implementations can re-use partsof other Internet service protocols such as HTTP and the Real-TimeStream Protocol (RTSP). In this paper, we describe SIP, and show howits basic primitives can be used to construct a wide range of telephonyservices.</td>

The goal isto synthesize a gate-level implementation that is initializable whensimulated by a 3-valued (0,1,X) simulator. The method builds on anexisting approach of Cheng and Agrawal, which uses constrained stateassignment to translate functional initializability into logicalinitializability. Here, a different state assignment method isproposed which, unlike the method of Cheng and Agrawal, is guaranteedsafe and yet is not as conservative. Furthermore, it is demonstratedthat certain new constraints on combinational logic synthesis are bothnecessary and sufficient to insure that the resulting gate-levelcircuit is 3-valued simulatable. Interestingly, these constraints aresimilar to those used for hazard-free synthesis of asynchronouscombinational circuits. Using the above constraints, we present acomplete synthesis for initializability method, targeted to bothtwo-level and multi-level circuits.</td>

Both minimizers can solve all currently availableexamples, which range up to 32 inputs and 33 outputs.These include examples that have never been solved before.For examples that can be solved by other minimizers ourmethods are several orders of magnitude faster.
As by-products of these algorithms, we also presenttwo additional results. First, we introduce a fast newalgorithm to check if a hazard-free covering problemcan feasibly be solved.

                    <td class="col-md-2">Data encryption has become an increasinglyimportant factor in everyday work. Users seek a method of securingtheir data with maximum comfort and minimum additional requirements ontheir part; they want a security system that protects any files usedby any of their applications, without resorting toapplication-specific encryption methods. Performance is an importantfactor to users since encryption can be time consuming. Operatingsystem vendors want to provide this functionality but withoutincurring the large costs of developing a new file system.
This paper describes the design and implementation of Cryptfs -- afile system that was designed as a stackable Vnode layer loadablekernel module. Cryptfs operates by &quot;encapsulating&quot; a client filesystem with a layer of encryption transparent to the user.
Being kernel resident, Cryptfs performs better than user-level or NFSbased file servers such as CFS and TCFS. It is 2 to 37 times faster onmicro-benchmarks such as read and write; this translates to 12-52\%application speedup, as exemplified by a large build. Cryptfs offersstronger security by basing its keys on process session IDs as well asuser IDs, and by the fact that kernel memory is harder toaccess. Working at and above the vnode level, Cryptfs is more portablethan a file system which works directly with native media such asdisks and networks. Cryptfs can operate on top of any other nativefile system such as UFS/FFS and NFS. Finally, Cryptfsrequires no changes to client file systems or remote servers.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">The Internet has grown much in popularity in thepast few years. Numerous users read USENET newsgroups daily forentertainment, work, study, and more. USENET News servers have seen agradual increase in the traffic exchanged between them, to a pointwhere the hardware and software supporting the servers is no longercapable of meeting demand, at which point the servers begin &quot;dropping&quot;articles they could not process. The rate of this increase has beenfaster than software or hardware improvements were able to keep up,resulting in much time and effort spent by administrators upgradingtheir news systems.
One of the primary reasons for the slowness of news servers has beenthe need to process many articles in very large flat directoriesrepresenting newsgroups such as control. cancel andmisc.jobs.offered. A large portion of the resources is spent onprocessing articles in these few newsgroups. Most Unix directoriesare organized as a linear unsorted sequence of entries. Largenewsgroups can have hundreds of thousands of articles in onedirectory, resulting in significant delays processing any singlearticle.
Usenetfs is a file system that rearranges the directory structure frombeing flat to one with small directories containing fewer articles. Bybreaking the structure into smaller directories, it improves theperformance of looking for, creating, or deleting files, since theseoperations occur on smaller directories. Usenetfs takes advantage ofarticle numbers; knowing that file names representing articles arecomposed of digits helps to bound the size of the smallerdirectories. Usenetfs improves overall performance by at least 22\%for average news servers; common news server operations such aslooking up, adding, and deleting articles are sped up by as much asseveral orders of magnitude.
Usenetfs was designed and implemented as a stackable Vnode layerloadable kernel module. It operates by &quot;encapsulating&quot; a client filesystem with a layer of directory management. To the processperforming directory operations through a mounted Usenetfs, alldirectories appear flat; but when inspecting the underlying storagethat it manages, small directories are visible.
Usenetfs is small and is transparent to the user. It requires nochange to News software, to other file systems, or to the rest of theoperating system. Usenetfs is more portable than other nativekernel-based file systems because it interacts with the Vnodeinterface which is similar on many different platforms.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">This thesis research concentrates on the problem of managing a distributed collection of intelligent learning agents across large and distributed databases. The main challenge is to identify and address the issues related to the efficiency, scalability,adaptivity and compatibility of these agents and the design andimplemention of a complete and coherent distributed meta-learning systemfor large scale data mining applications. The resulting system should beable to scale with many large databases and make effective use of the available system resources. Furthemore, it should be capable to adapt tochanges in its computational environment and be flexible enough to circumvent variances in database schema definitions. In this thesis proposal we present the architecture of JAM(Java Agents for Meta-learning),a distributed data mining system, and we describe in detail several methods to cope with the issues of scalability, efficiency, adaptivityand compatibility. Through experiments, performed on actual credit cardand other public domain data sets, we evaluate the effectiveness and performance of our approaches and we demonstrate their potential.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">In this proposal, we present comprehensive andsystematic approaches of building systems that can automaticallygenerate coherent visual discourse for interactive envirornments. Avisual discourse refers to a series of connected visual displays. Acoherent visual discourse requires smooth transitions betweendisplays, consistent designs within and among displays, and effectiveintegration of various components. While our main research goal is todevelop approaches to automatically create coherent, versatile, andinteractive visual discourse, we also emphasize integrating theseapproaches into a general framework to provide a reference model inwhich a specific system is considered an instantiation of theframework. In other words, the framework should consist of a knowledgebase, an inference engine, a visual realizer, and an interactionhandler. As a consequence, not only can a general framework serve as atemplate from which a specific generation system can be instantiated,but the framework also can be used as a base for comparing orevaluating different systems. We concentrate on the basic issuesinvolved in developing comprehensive and systematic approaches toensure a visual discourse&#039;s coherence, versatility, andinteractivity. In particular, To ensure coherence, we have establisheda set of comprehensive design criteria to measure both expressivenessand effectiveness of a visual discourse. To provide versatility, weaddress the design of visual discourse for heterogeneousinformation. Within such discussions, heterogeneous information refersto both quantitative and qualitative, or static and dynamicinformation. In addition, we are also concerned with characterizingand employing different visual media and a wide variety of visualtechniques. To support interaction, we integrate many conventionaluser interface metaphors and styles into visual discourse design andexplore reactive planning approaches to provide proper response touser interactions. To establish the framework, we identify variousknowledge sources and determine effective knowledge representationparadigms in constructing the knowledge base. We emphasize theefficiency, usability, and flexibility issues in modeling theinference engine. We are concerned with portability andparallelization issues in building the visual realizer, and we alsotake into account interaction capabilities for interactiveenvironments. We describe a system called IMPROVISE (IllustrativeMetaphor Production in Reactive Object-oriented VISual Environments)that serves as a proof-of-concept prototype. IMPROVISE is built basedon our framework, aiming to automatically generate coherent visualdiscourse for various application domains in interactiveenvironments. IMPROVISE has been used in two testbed applicationdomains to demonstrate its generality and flexibility. Examples fromboth domains will be given to illustrate IMPROVISE&#039;s generationprocess and to identify the future research areas.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We are concerned with the complexity of $2m$thorder elliptic two-point boundary-value problems $Lu=f$. Previouswork on the complexity of these problems has generally assumed that wehad partial information about the right-hand side~$f$ and completeinformation about the coefficients of~$L$, often making unrealisticassumptions about the smoothness of the coefficients of~$L$. In thispaper, we study problems in which $f$ has $r$ derivatives in the$L_p$-sense and for~$L$ having the usual divergence form $$Lv =\sum_{0\le i,j\le m} (-1)^i D^i(a_{i,j}D^jv),$$ with $a_{i,j}$ being$r_{i,j}$-times continuously differentiable. We find that ifcontinuous information is permissible, then the$\varepsilon$-complexity is proportional to$(1/\varepsilon)^{1/(\tilde r+m)}$, where $$\tilder=\min\{\,r,\min_{0\le i,j\le m} \{ r_{i,j}-i \}\,\},$$ and show thata finite element method (FEM) is optimal. If only standardinformation (consisting of function and/or derivative evaluations) isavailable, we find that the complexity is proportional to$(1/\varepsilon)^{1/{r_{\mathop{\rm min}}}}$, where $$r_{\mathop{\rmmin}}=\min\{\,r,\min_{0\le i,j\le m} \{ r_{i,j} \}\,\},$$ and we showthat a modified FEM (which uses only function evaluations, and notderivatives) is optimal.</td>

First I review a method for applying theinformation retrieval metrics of recall and precision to coreferenceannotation proposed by Marc Vilain and his collaborators. I show howthis method makes it possible to construct contingency tables forcomputing Cohen&#039;s Kappa, a familiar reliability metric. By comparingrecall and precision to reliability on the same data sets, I also showthat recall and precision can be misleadingly high. Because Kappafactors out chance agreement among coders, it is a preferable measurefor developing annotated corpora where no pre-existing targetannotation exists.</td>

A catadioptric sensor uses a combination oflenses and mirrors placed in a carefully arranged configuration tocapture a much wider field of view. When designing a catadioptricsensor, the shape of the mirror(s) should ideally be selected toensure that the complete catadioptric system has a single effectiveviewpoint. The reason a single viewpoint is so desirable is that it isa requirement for the generation of pure perspective images from thesensed image(s). In this paper, we derive and analyze the completeclass of single-lens single-mirror catadioptric sensors which satisfythe fixed viewpoint constraint. Some of the solutions turn out to bedegenerate with no practical value, while other solutions lead torealizable sensors. We also derive an expression for the spatialresolution of a catadioptric sensor, and include a preliminaryanalysis of the defocus blur caused by the use of a curved mirror.</td>

In this paper, weconsider the class of weighted $\mathrm{L}^{2}$ norms as potentialfitting functions and study the effect which the choice of fittingfunction has on one particular aspect of performance, namely parameterestimation accuracy. We first derive an optimality criterion basedupon how far an ideal feature instance is perturbed around the featuremanifold when noise is added to it. We then show that a first-order(linear) approximation to the feature manifold results in theEuclidean $\mathrm{L}^{2}$ norm being optimal. We next showempirically that for non-linear manifolds the Euclidean$\mathrm{L}^{2}$ norm is no longer, in general, optimal. Finally, wepresent the results of several experiments comparing the performanceof various weighting functions on a number of ubiquitous features.</td>

This noisy FEMQ can beefficiently implemented using multigrid techniques. Using theseresults, we find tight bounds on the $\varepsilon$-complexity (minimalcost of calculating an $\varepsilon$-approximation) for this problem,said bounds depending on the cost~$c(\delta)$ of calculating a$\delta$-noisy information value.

Can one do better than recomputing the view from the base relations? Traditional view maintenance tries to maintain the materialized view in response to modifications to the base relations; we try to ``adapt&#039;&#039; the view in response to changes in the view definition.
Such techniques are needed for applications where the user can changequeries dynamically and see the changes in the results fast. Dataarchaeology, data visualization, and dynamic queries are examples ofsuch applications.
We consider all possible redefinitions of SQL\Select-\From-\Where-\Groupby-\Having, \Union, and \Minus\ views, and show howthese views can be adapted using the old materialization for the caseswhere it is possible to do so. We identify extra informationthat can be kept with a materialization to facilitate redefinition.Multiple simultaneous changesto a view can be handledwithout necessarily materializing intermediate results. Weidentify guidelines for users and database administrators that can beused to facilitate efficient view adaptation.
We perform a systematic experimental evaluation of our proposedtechniques. Our evaluation indicates that adaptation is more efficient thanrematerialization in most cases. Certain adaptation techniques can be up to1,000 times better. We also point out the physical layouts that can benefitadaptation.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Much of the research in inductive learning concentrateson problems with relatively small amounts of data. With the coming age ofubiquitous network computing, it is likely that orders of magnitudemore data in databases will be available for various learning problemsof real world importance. Some learning algorithms assume that theentire data set fits into main memory, which is not feasible formassive amounts of data, especially for applications in data mining.One approach to handling a large data set is to partition the data setinto subsets, run the learning algorithm on each of the subsets, andcombine the results. Moreover, data can be inherently distributedacross multiple sites on the network and merging all the data in onelocation can be expensive or prohibitive.
In this thesis we propose, investigate, and evaluate a {\itmeta-learning} approach to integrating the results of multiplelearning processes. Our approach utilizes machine learning to guidethe integration. We identified two main meta-learning strategies:{\it combiner} and {\it arbiter}. Both strategies are independent tothe learning algorithms used in generating the classifiers. Thecombiner strategy attempts to reveal relationships among the learnedclassifiers&#039; prediction patterns. The arbiter strategy tries todetermine the correct prediction when the classifiers have differentopinions. Various schemes under these two strategies have beendeveloped. Empirical results show that our schemes can obtainaccurate classifiers from inaccurate classifiers trained from datasubsets. We also implemented and analyzed the schemes in a paralleland distributed environment to demonstrate their scalability.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">In this work, we investigate the visual appearanceof real-world surfaces and the dependence of appearance on scale,viewing direction and illumination direction. At fine scale, surfacevariations cause local intensity variation or image texture. Theappearance of this texture depends on both illumination and viewingdirection and can be characterized by the BTF (bidirectional texturefunction). At sufficiently coarse scale, local image texture is notresolvable and local image intensity is uniform. The dependence ofthis image intensity on illumination and viewing direction isdescribed by the BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distributionfunction). We simultaneously measure the BTF and BRDF of over 60different rough surfaces, each observed with over 200 differentcombinations of viewing and illumination direction. The resulting BTFdatabase is comprised of over 12,000 image textures. To enableconvenient use of the BRDF measurements, we fit the measurements totwo recent models and obtain a BRDF parameter database. Theseparameters can be used directly in image analysis and synthesis of awide variety of surfaces. The BTF, BRDF, and BRDF parameter databaseshave important implications for computer vision and computer graphicsand each is made publicly available.</td>

In this paper, we present a fileprefetching mechanism that is based on on-line analytic modeling ofinteresting system events and is transparent to higher levels. Themechanism, incorporated into a client&#039;s file cache manager, seeks tobuild semantic structures, called access trees, that capture thecorrelations between file accesses. It then heuristically uses thesestructures to represent distinct file usage patterns and exploits themto prefetch files from a file server. We show results of a simulationstudy and of a working implementation. Measurements suggest that ourmethod can predict future file accesses with an accuracy around 90\%,that it can reduce cache miss rate by up to 47\% and applicationlatency by up to 40\%. Our method imposes little overhead, even underantagonistic circumstances.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Two new algorithms, ``Jive-join&#039;&#039; and``Slam-join,&#039;&#039; are proposed for computing the join of two relationsusing a join index. The algorithms are duals: Jive-joinrange-partitions input relation tuple-ids then processes eachpartition, while Slam-join forms ordered runs of input relationtuple-ids and then merges the results. Each algorithm has featuresthat make it preferable to the other depending on the context in whichit is being used. Both algorithms make a single sequential passthrough each input relation, in addition to one pass through the joinindex and two passes through a temporary file whose size is half thatof the join index. Both algorithms perform this efficiently even whenthe relations are much larger than main memory, as long as the numberof blocks in main memory is of the order of the square root of thenumber of blocks in the smaller relation. By storing intermediate andfinal join results in a vertically partitioned fashion, our algorithmsneed to manipulate less data in memory at a given time than otheralgorithms. Almost all the I/O of our algorithms is sequential, thusminimizing the impact of seek and rotational latency. The algorithmsare resistant to data skew and adaptive to memory fluctuations. Theycan be extended to handle joins of multiple relations by usingmultidimensional partitioning while still making only a single passover each input relation. They can also be extended to handle joinsof relations that do not satisfy the memory bound by recursivelyapplying the algorithms. We also show how selection conditions can beincorporated into the algorithms. Using a detailed cost model, thealgorithms are analyzed and compared with competing algorithms. Forlarge input relations, our algorithms perform significantly betterthan Valduriez&#039;s algorithm and hash join algorithms. An experimentalstudy is also conducted to validate the analytical results and todemonstrate the performance characteristics of each algorithm inpractice.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">High-dimensional integrals are usually solved withMonte Carlo algorithms although theory suggests that low discrepancyalgorithms are sometimes superior. We report on numerical testingwhich compares low discrepancy and Monte Carlo algorithms on theevaluation of financial derivatives. The testing is performed on aCollateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO) which is formulated as thecomputation of ten integrals of dimension up to 360. We tested two low discrepancy algorithms (Sobol and Halton) and tworandomized algorithms (classical Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo combinedwith antithetic variables). We conclude that for this CMO the Sobolalgorithm is always superior to the other algorithms. We believe thatit will be advantageous to use the Sobol algorithm for many othertypes of financial derivatives. Our conclusion regarding the superiority of the Sobol algorithm alsoholds when a rather small number of sample points are used, animportant case in practice. We have built a software system called FINDER for computing highdimensional integrals. Routines for computing Sobol points have beenpublished. However, we incorporated major improvements in FINDER andwe stress that the results reported here were obtained using thissoftware. The software system FINDER runs on a network of heterogeneousworkstations under PVM 3.2 (Parallel Virtual Machine). Sinceworkstations are ubiquitous, this is a cost-effective way to do verylarge computations fast. The measured speedup is at least $.9N$ for$N$ workstations, $N \leq 25$. The software can also be used tocompute high dimensional integrals on a single workstation.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Description logics are knowledge representationformalisms in the tradition of frames and semantic networks, but withan emphasis on formal semantics. A terminology contains descriptionsof concepts, such as UNIVERSITY, which are automatically classified ina taxonomy via subsumption inferences. Individuals such as COLUMBIAare described in terms of those concepts. This thesis enhances thescope and utility of description logics by exploiting new completenessassumptions during problem solving and by extending the expressivenessof descriptions. First, we introduce a predictive concept recognition methodology basedon a new closed terminology assumption (CTA). The terminology isdynamically partitioned by modalities (necessary, optional, andimpossible) with respect to individuals as they are specified. In ourinteractive configuration application, a user incrementally specifiesan individual computer system and its components in collaboration witha configuration engine. Choices can be made in any order and at anylevel of abstraction. We distinguish between abstract and concreteconcepts to formally define when an individual&#039;s description may beconsidered finished. We also exploit CTA, together with theterminology&#039;s subsumption-based organization, to efficiently track thetypes of systems and components consistent with current choices, inferadditional constraints on current choices, and appropriately restrictfuture choices. Thus, we can help focus the efforts of both user andconfiguration engine. This work is implemented in the K-REP system. Second, we show that a new class of complex descriptions can be formedvia constraint networks over standard descriptions. For example, wemodel plans as constraint networks whose nodes represent actions.Arcs represent qualitative and metric temporal constraints, plusco-reference constraints, between actions. By combiningterminological reasoning with constraint satisfaction techniques,subsumption is extended to constraint networks, allowing automaticclassification of a plan library. This work is implemented in theT-REX system, which integrates and builds upon an existing descriptionlogic system (K-REP or CLASSIC) and temporal reasoner (MATS). Finally, we combine the preceding, orthogonal results to conductpredictive recognition of constraint network concepts. As an example,this synthesis enables a new approach to deductive plan recognition,illustrated with travel plans. This work is also realized in T-REX.</td>

In some cases, a new architecture canbe developed, for example to convert a monolithic system to theclient/server paradigm, and the old components plugged into placealong with some new ones. We update a 1994 publication in thisconference series, where we proposed using process modeling andenactment technology to support both construction of systems fromcomponents and re-engineering of systems to permit componentreplacement. This paper describes our experience following thatapproach through two generations of component-oriented process models.</td>

To insure correct operation, modifiedlatch and multiplexer designs are presented, for both dual-rail andsingle-rail implementations.

Atomicity is a standard correctness model for guaranteeing that a set of operations occurs as an atomic unit, or none of them occur at all. Within a single WFMS, atomicity is the concern of its transaction manager. In a decentralized environment, however, the autonomous transaction managers must find ways to cooperate if an atomic unit is split between multiple WFMSs. This paper describes a flexible atomicity model that enables workflow administrators to specify the scope of multi-site atomicity based upon the desired semantics of multi-site tasks in the decentralized WFMS.</td>

space. Examples of these mappings are used to construct a continuous
function that approximates the given data and generalizes for intermediate
instances. Radial basis function (RBF) networks are used to formulate this
approximating function. A novel method is introduced that
automatically constructs a RBF network for a given mapping and error
bound. This network is shown to be the smallest network within the error bound
for the given mapping. The integral wavelet transform is used to determine the 
parameters of the network. Simple one-dimensional examples are used to 
demonstrate how the network constructed using the transform is superior to one
constructed using standard ad hoc optimization techniques. The paper concludes
with the automatic generation of a network for a multidimensional problem,

enabling technology for multi-user computer-based systems, particularly in
cases where synchronous human-human interaction is required between
geographically dispersed users. Workflow is an emerging
technology that supports complex business processes in modern corporations
by allowing to explicitly define the process, and by supporting its
execution in a workflow management system (WFMS). 
Since workflow inherently involves humans carrying out parts of
the process, it is only natural to explore how to synergize these two
technologies. We analyze the relationships between groupware and workflow 
management, present our general approach to integrating synchronous
groupware tools into a WFMS, and conclude with an example process that
was implemented in the WFMS and integrated such tools.  Our main
contribution lies in the integration and synchronization of individual
groupware activities into modeled workflow processes, as opposed to being
a built-in part of the workflow WFMS.

CMMs differ from Hidden Markov Models in that state sequence assignments
can take on values coerced from external sources.
Given a Chinese sentence, a CMM can be used to predict the
corresponding English tag sequence, thus constraining the English
lexical sequence produced by a translation model.
The CMM can also be used to score competing translation hypotheses in
N-best models. Three fundamental problems for CMM designed are discussed. Their
solutions lead to the training and testing stages of CMM.

                    <td class="col-md-2">Many commercial organizations routinely gather large numbers of 
databases for various marketing and business analysis functions. 
The task is to correlate information from different databases by
identifying distinct individuals that appear in a number of
different databases typically in an inconsistent and often
incorrect fashion.  The problem we study here is the task of
merging data from multiple sources in as efficient manner as
possible, while maximizing the accuracy of the result.  We call
this the m merge/purge problem.  The key to successful
merging requires  a means of identifying &quot;equivalent&quot;  data from
diverse sources.  The determination that two pieces of information
are equivalent, and that they represent some aspect of the same
domain entity, depends on sophisticated inference techniques and
knowledge of the domain.  We introduce the use of a rule program
that declaratively specifies an &quot;equational theory&quot; for this purpose.
Furthermore, the number and size of the data sets involved may be
so large that parallel and distributed computing systems may be
the only hope for achieving accurate results in a reasonable amount
of time with acceptable cost.   In this paper we detail the
&quot;sorted neighborhood&quot; method that is used by some commercial
organizations to solve merge/purge and present experimental results
that demonstrates this approach works well in practice but at
great expense.  An alternative method based upon clustering is
also presented with a comparative evaluation to the sorted
neighborhood method.  We show a means of improving the accuracy
of the results based upon a &quot;multi-pass&quot; approach that succeeds by
computing the Transitive Closure over the results of independent
runs considering alternative primary key attributes in each pass.
The moral is that a multiplicity of &quot;cheap&quot; passes produces higher
accuracy than one &quot;expensive&quot; pass over the data.

This paper  overviews an  electronic design  and implementation  of  a
scaleable  gigabit  per second  multi-protocol  switch  based  on  the
Isochronets  high-speed  network  architecture.  Isochronets   do  not
require frame  header processing  in  the switches  and, consequently,
they  are  scaleable   with  link   speeds,  support  multiple   frame
structures, and  are  suitable for  all-optical  implementations.  The
electronic   switch  has  low  cost   and  uses  simple  off-the-shelf
components. The switch interface is simple and provides novel services
such  as  guaranteed  Quality  of Service  (QoS)  and  propagation  of
synchronization   signals   to   upper  protocol   layers,   including
applications. The switch allows the negotiation of QoS while promoting
flexible resource sharing.  This  paper also proposes  an  all-optical
switch design that can be realized  with current  optical devices. The
modular  switch  designs are  scaleable  in  number of nodes  and link
speed. Using faster  implementation technology, the electronic  design
can reach scores of gigabits per second, while the all-optical  design
can potentially operate at terabits per second.

                    <td class="col-md-2">This paper overviews the novel Route Switching (RS) technique.  In RS,
network  nodes switch different routing trees over time. Traffic moves
along routing trees to the roots  during the tree activation period or
band. Contrary to circuits, routes do not change frequently,  allowing
RS  to   pre-established  routes  for  prolonged  network  operations.
Contrary to  packets,  routes can be switched over  time without frame
header processing, allowing RS to scale to any network speed and to be
implemented using all-optical technology. RS  provide flexible quality
of service control and multicasting  through  allocation  of  bands to
trees. They can be tuned to span a spectrum of performance  behaviors,
outperforming both Circuit or  Packet  Switching, as evidenced by  the
performance  study  in  this  paper.  RS  is the basis  for the  novel
Isochronets  high-speed network architecture. Isochronets  operate  at
the  media-access  layer  and can support  multiple framing  protocols
simultaneously. Internetworking  is  reduced  to a  simple media-layer
bridging.  A  gigabit-per-second  Isochronet switch prototype has been
implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of RS.

                    <td class="col-md-2">Message-based architectures have typically been used for integrating an
engineer&#039;s set of tools as in FIELD and SoftBench. This paper presents our
experience using a message-based architecture to integrate complex,
multi-user environments. Where this style of control integration has been
effective for encapsulating independent tools within an environment, we
show that these techniques are also useful for integrating environments
themselves.
 
Our experience comes from our integration of two types of process-centered
software development environments: a groupware application that implements
a Fagan-style code inspection process and a software development process
environment where code inspection is a single step in the overall process.
We use a message-based mechanism to federate the two process engines such
that the two process formalisms complement rather than compete with each
other. Moreover, we see that the two process engines can provide some
synergy when used in a single, integrated software process environment,

Specifically, the integrated environment uses the process modeling and
enactment services of one process engine to customize and extend the code
inspection process implemented in a different process engine. The
customization and extension of the original collaborative application was
accomplished without modifying the application. This was possible because
the integration mechanism was designed for multi-user, distributed
evironments and encouraged the use of an environment&#039;s services by other
environments. The results of our study indicate that the message-based
architecture originally conceived for tool-oriented control integration is
equally well-suited for environment integration.

where $L\colon G\to X$ is a bounded linear injection, $G$ is a Hilbert
space, and $X$ is a normed linear space.  Past work on the complexity
of such problems has generally assumed that the class~$F$ of problem
elements~$f$ to be the unit ball of~$X$.  However, there are many
problems for which this choice of~$F$ yields unsatisfactory results.
Mixed elliptic-hyperbolic problems are one example, the difficulty
being that our technical tools are not strong enoguh to give good
complexity bounds.  Ill-posed problems are another example, because we
know that the complexity of computing finite-error approximations is
infinite if $F$ is a ball in~$X$.  In this paper, we pursue another
idea.  Rather than directly restrict the class~$F$ of problem
elements~$f$, we will consider problems that are solution-restricted,
i.e., we restrict the class$~U$ of solution elements~$u$.  In
particular, we assume that~$U$ is the unit ball of a Hilbert space~$W$
continuously embedded in~$G$.

The main idea is that our problem can be reduced to the standard {\it
approximation problem\/} of approximating the embedding of $W$
into~$G$.  This allows us to characterize optimal information and
algorithms for our problem.  Then, we consider specific applications.
The first application we consider is any problem for which $G$ and~$W$
are standard Sobolev Hilbert spaces; we call this the ``standard
problem&#039;&#039; since it includes many problems of practical interest.  We
show that finite element information and generalized Galerkin methods
are nearly optimal for standard problems.  We then look at elliptic
boundary-value problems, Fredholm integral equations of the second
kind, the Tricomi problem (a mixed hyperbolic-elliptic problem arising
in the study of transonic flow), the inverse finite Laplace transform,
and the backwards heat equation.  (Note that with the exception of the
backwards heat equation, all of these are standard problems.
Moreover, the inverse finite Laplace transform and the backwards heat
equation are ill-posed problems.)  We determine the problem complexity
and derive nearly optimal algorithms for all these problems.

archaeology, data visualization, and dynamic queries are examples of
such applications.

We consider all possible redefinitions of SQL
Select-From-Where-Groupby-Having, Union, and Except views, and show
how these views can be adapted using the old materialization for the
cases where it is possible to do so.  We identify extra information
that can be kept with a materialization to facilitate redefinition.
Multiple simultaneous changes to a view can be handled without
necessarily materializing intermediate results.  We identify
guidelines for users and database administrators that can be used to
facilitate efficient view adaptation.

                    <td class="col-md-2">Transition signaling is a popular technique used in the design of unclocked digital systems.  A number of basic modules have been developed by various researchers for use in such systems, and they have presented ingenious circuits for implementing them.  In this paper, a method is presented for describing the behavior of such modules clearly and concisely by means of transition flow tables.  These tables can be used to generate Huffman type primitive flow tables.  All of the formal (and informal) techniques developed for the design of asynchronous sequential logic circuits can then be applied to develop implementations with attention to problems of hazards, metastability, and the like.  These transition tables may also be useful for describing larger subsystems.

(or extended) using the services provided by PCTE. Oz historically has had a
native OMS component whereas the PCTE OMS is an open data repository with an

the PCTE OMS. This paper describes how several Oz components were changed
in order to make the Oz server interface with the PCTE OMS. The resulting 
system of our experiment is an environment that has process control and 
integration services provided by Oz, data integration services provided by 
PCTE, and tool integration services provided by both. We discusses in depth 
the concurrency control problems that arise in such an environment and 
their solutions. The PCTE implementation used in our experiment is the

                    <td class="col-md-2">The efficiency of pattern recognition is critical when there are a large 
number of classes to be discriminated, or when the recognition algorithm
must be applied a large number of times. We propose and analyze a general
technique, namely pattern rejection, that leads to great efficiency
improvements in both cases. Rejectors are introduced as algorithms that
very quickly eliminate from further consideration,
most of the classes or inputs (depending on the setting).
Importantly, a number of rejectors may be combined
to form a composite rejector, which performs far more effectively than 
any of its
component rejectors. Composite rejectors are analyzed, and conditions
derived which guarantee both efficiency and practicality.
A general technique is proposed for  the construction of
rejectors, based on a single assumption about the pattern
classes. The generality is shown
through a close relationship with the Karhunen-Lo\&#039;{e}ve expansion.
Further, a comparison with Fisher&#039;s discriminant analysis is
included to illustrate the benefits of pattern rejection.
Composite rejectors were constructed for two
applications, namely, object recognition
and local feature detection. In both cases, a substantial
improvement in efficiency over existing techniques is demonstrated.

                    <td class="col-md-2">This dissertation investigates decentralization of software processes
and Process Centered Environments (PCEs), and addresses a wide range of
issues concerned with supporting interoperability and collaboration
among autonomous and heterogeneous processes, both in their definition
and in their execution in possibly physically dispersed PCEs.

Decentralization is addressed at three distinct levels of abstraction.
The first proposes a generic conceptual model that is both language- and
PCE-independent. The second level explores the realization of the model
in a specific PCE, Oz, and its rule-based process modeling
language. The third level addresses architectural issues in
interconnecting autonomous PCEs as a basis for process interoperability.

Two key concerns guide this research. The first is maximizing local
autonomy, so as not to force a priori any global constraints on the
definition and execution of local processes, unless explicitly and
voluntarily specified by a particular process instance. The second
concern is tailorability, dynamicity and fine-grained control over the
degree of interoperability.

The essence of the interoperability model lies in two abstraction
mechanisms --- Treaty and Summit --- for inter-process
definition and execution, respectively. Treaties enable to specify
shared sub-processes while retaining the privacy of local
sub-processes. To promote autonomy, Treaties are established by
explicit and active participation of the involved processes. To
promote fine granularity, Treaties are defined pairwise
between two collaborating processes and formed over a possibly small
sub-process unit, although multi-site Treaties over large shared
sub-processes can be constructed, if desired. Finally, Treaties
are superimposed on top of pre-existing instantiated processes,
enabling their dynamic and incremental establishment and
supporting a decentralized bottom-up approach.

Summits are the execution counterparts of Treaties. They support
``global&#039;&#039; execution of shared sub-processes involving artifacts
and/or users from multiple sites, as well as local execution of
private sub-processes. Summits successively alternate between shared
and private execution modes, where the former is used for synchronous
execution of shared activities, and the latter for autonomous
execution of any private subtasks emanating from the shared activities
as defined in the local processes.

                    <td class="col-md-2">Translating domain-specific terms is one significant component of machine
translation and machine-aided translation systems. These terms are often
not found in standard dictionaries. Human translators, not being experts in
every technical or regional domain, cannot produce their translations
effectively. Automatic translation of domain-specific terms is therefore
highly desirable.
 
Most other work on automatic term translation uses statistical information
of words from parallel corpora. Parallel corpora of clean, translated texts
are hard to come by whereas there are more noisy, translated texts and many
more monolingual texts in various domains. We propose using noisy parallel
texts and same-domain texts of a pair of languages to translate terms.
 
In our work, we propose using a novel paradigm of pattern matching of
statistical signals of word features. These features are robust to the
syntactic structure, character sets, language of the text, and to 
the domain.  We obtain statistical information which is related to the
lexical properties of a word and its translation in any other language of
the same domain. These lexical properties are extracted from the corpora
and represented in vector form.  We propose using signal processing
techniques for matching these features vectors of a word to those of its
translation. Another matching technique we propose is applying
discriminative analysis of the word features.  For each word, the various
features are combined into a single vector which is then transformed into a
smaller dimension eigenvector for matching.

Since most domain specific terms are nouns and noun phrases, we concentrate
on translating English nouns and noun phrases into other languages.  We
study the relationship between English noun phrases and their translations
in Chinese, Japanese and French in parallel corpora. The result of this
study is used in our system for translation of English noun phrases into
these other languages from noisy parallel and non-parallel corpora.

                    <td class="col-md-2">We are interested in the complexity of the Poisson problem with
homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on the $d$-dimensional unit
cube~$\Omega$.  Error is measured in the energy norm, and only
standard information (consisting of function evaluations) is
available.  In previous work on this problem, the standard assumption
has been that the class~$F$ of problem elements has been the unit ball
of a Sobolev space of fixed smoothness~$r$, in which case the
$\e$-complexity is proportional to $\e^{-d/r}$.  Given this
exponential dependence on~$d$, the problem is intractable for such
classes~$F$.  In this paper, we seek to overcome this intractability
by allowing $F$ to be the unit ball of a space $\circhrho$ of bounded
mixed derivatives, with $\rho$ a fixed multi-index with positive
entries.  We find that the complexity is proportional to
$c(d)(1/\e)^{1/\rhomin}[\ln(1/\e)]^b$, and we give bounds
on~$b=b_{\rho,d}$.  Hence, the problem is tractable in $1/\e$, with
exponent at most~$1/\rhomin$.  The upper bound on the complexity
(which is close to the lower bound) is attained by a modified finite
element method (MFEM) using discrete blending spline spaces; we obtain
an explicit bound (with no hidden constants) on the cost of using this
MFEM to compute $\e$-approximations.  Finally, we show that for any
positive multi-index ~$\rho$, the Poisson problem is strongly
tractable, and that the MFEM using discrete blended piecewise
polynomial splines of degree~$\rho$ is a strongly polynomial time
algorithm.  In particular, for the case $\rho={\bf 1}$, the MFEM using
discrete blended piecewise linear splines produces an
$\e$-approximation with cost at most
$$0.839262\,(c(d)+2)\left({1\over\e}\right)^{5.07911}.$$

                    <td class="col-md-2">This document addresses some problems raised by the well-known
intractability of deductive reasoning in even moderately expressive
knowledge representation systems.

Starting from boolean constraint propagation (BCP), a previously known
linear-time incomplete reasoner for clausal propositional theories, we
develop {\em fact propagation} (FP) to deal with non-clausal theories, after
motivating the need for such an extension.  FP is specified using a
confluent rewriting systems, for which we present an algorithm that
has quadratic-time complexity in general, but is still linear-time for
clausal theories.  FP is the only known tractable extension of BCP to
non-clausal theories; we prove that it performs strictly more
inferences than CNF-BCP, a previously-proposed extension of BCP to
non-clausal theories.

We generalize a refutation reasoner based on FP to a family of sound
and tractable reasoners that are ``increasingly complete&#039;&#039; for
propositional theories.  These can be used for anytime reasoning,
i.e., they provide partial answers even if they are stopped
prematurely, and the ``completeness&#039;&#039; of the answer improves with the
time used in computing it. A fixpoint construction based on FP
gives an alternate characterization of the reasoners in this family,
and is used to define a transformation of arbitrary theories into
logically-equivalent ``vivid&#039;&#039; theories --- ones for which our FP
algorithm is complete.

Our final contribution is to the description of tractable classes of
reasoning problems. Based on FP, we develop a new property, called
bounded intricacy, which is shared by a variety of tractable classes
that were previously presented, for example, in the areas of
propositional satisfiability, constraint satisfaction, and
OR-databases. Although proving bounded intricacy for these classes
requires domain-specific techniques (which are based on the original
tractability proofs), bounded intricacy is one more tool available for
showing that a family of problems arising in some application is
tractable. As we demonstrate in the case of constraint satisfaction
and disjunctive logic programs, bounded intricacy can also be used to
uncover new tractable classes.

                    <td class="col-md-2">Traditional  network  architectures present two main  limitations when
applied to  High-Speed Networks (HSNs):   they do not scale with  link
speeds and they do not adequately support the Quality of Service (QoS)
needs  of high-performance applications.   This thesis  introduces the
Isochronets architecture that overcomes both limitations.

Isochronets  view frame  motions over links  in  analogy to motions on
roads.  In the latter, traffic lights  can synchronize to create green
waves   of uninterrupted    motion.   Isochronets   accomplish similar
uninterrupted motion by  periodically configuring network switches  to
create  end-to-end routes  in the  network.   Frames flow along  these
routes with no required header processing at intermediate switches.

Isochronets offer several  advantages. First, they  are scaleable with
respect to transmission speeds. Switches merely  configure routes on a
time scale  that is significantly longer than  and independent  of the
average frame   transmission time.  Isochronets do  not  require frame
processing  and  thus avoid conversions   from  optical to  electronic
representations.  They  admit  efficient  optical transmissions  under
electronically controlled switches.

Second, Isochronets ensure  QoS  for high-performance applications  in
terms  of     latency,   jitter,     loss,    and  other       service
qualities. Isochronet switches can give   priority to frames  arriving
from selected links.  At one  extreme, they  may   give a source   the
right-of-way to the destination by assigning  priority to all links in
its path.  Additionally,  other sources  may still transmit   at lower
priority. At the  other extreme, they  may give no priority to sources
and  frames en route to  the same destination contend for intermediate
links. In  between,  Isochronets can accomplish  a myriad  of priority
allocations with diverse QoS.

Third, Isochronets  can support  multiple protocols without adaptation
between different frame  structures. End nodes view  the network  as a
media access layer that accepts frames of arbitrary structure.

The main  contributions   of  this thesis  are:  (1)   design   of the
Isochronets architecture;  (2) design and  implementation of a gigabit
per  second Isochronet switch    (Isoswitch);  (3) definition of   the
Loosely-synchronous Transfer Mode  (LTM) and the  Synchronous Protocol
Stack  (SPS)  that  add synchronous and  isochronous  services  to any
existing protocol    stack;  and   (4)    performance evaluation    of
Isochronets.

  advanced application domains, such as software development environments,
  network management, workflow management systems, computer-aided design
  and manufacturing, and managed healthcare.  In these domains, the
  standard correctness model of serializability is often too restrictive.
  We introduce the notion of a Concurrency Control Language (CCL) that
  allows a database application designer to specify concurrency control
  policies to tailor the behavior of a transaction manager.  A well-crafted
  set of policies defines an extended transaction model.  The necessary
  semantic information required by the CCL run-time engine is extracted
  from a task manager, a (logical) module by definition included in
  all advanced applications.  This module stores task models that encode
  the semantic information about the transactions submitted to the DBMS.
  We have designed a rule-based CCL, called CORD, and have implemented a
  run-time engine that can be hooked to a conventional transaction manager
  to implement the sophisticated concurrency control required by advanced
  database applications.  We present an architecture for systems based on
  CORD and describe how we integrated the CORD engine with the Exodus
  Storage Manager to implement Altruistic Locking.

edges, lines, corners, and junctions.
We present a general framework for the design and
implementation of detectors for parametrized features.
For robustness, we argue in favor of elaborate modeling of features
as they appear in the physical world. In addition,
optical and sensing artifacts are incorporated to achieve
realistic feature models in  image domain.
Each feature is represented as a densely sampled
parameterized manifold in a low-dimensional subspace.
During detection, the brightness distribution around each
image pixel is projected to the subspace. If the projection
lies close to the feature manifold, the exact location of
the closest manifold point reveals the parameters of the
feature. The concepts of parameter reduction 
by normalization, dimension reduction, pattern rejection, and efficient
search are employed to achieve high efficiency.

Detectors have been
implemented for five specific features, namely, step edge (5 parameters),
roof edge (5 parameters), line (6 parameters), corner (5 parameters),
and circular disc (6 parameters). All five of these detectors
were generated using the same technique by simply inputing 
different feature models. Detailed experiments are reported on the
robustness of detection and the accuracy of parameter estimation.
In the case of the step edge, our results are compared with those
obtained using popular detectors. We conclude with a brief discussion
on the use of relaxation to refine outputs from multiple feature
detectors, and sketch a hardware architecture for a general
feature detection machine.

model, evolve, and enact the process of software development

process-interoperability among decentralized and autonomous PSEEs by
presenting the generic International Alliance model, which consists of
two elements, namely Treaty and Summit. The Treaty abstraction allows
pairwise peer-peer definition of multi-site shared sub-processes that
are integrated inside each of the participating sites, 
while retaining the definition- and evolution-autonomy of non-shared
local sub-processes. Summits are the execution abstraction for
Treaty-defined sub-processes. They enact Treaty sub-processes in
multiple sites by successively alternating between shared and private
execution modes: the former is used for the synchronous execution of the
shared activities, and the latter is used for the autonomous execution
of any private subtasks emanating from the shared activities. We
describe the realization of the models in the Oz multi-site PSEE and
evaluate the models and system based on experience gained from using Oz
for production purposes. We also consider the application of the model
to Petri net-based and grammar-based PSEEs.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Distributed multimedia applications are sensitive  to the Quality of Service
(QoS) delivered by underlying communication networks.   For example, a video
conference exchange  can  be   very  sensitive  to  the  effective   network
throughput. Network jitter can  greatly  disrupt a  speech stream. The  main
question this  thesis addresses is  how to adapt  multimedia applications to
the QoS delivered by the network and vice versa.

Such adaptation is especially important because  current networks are unable
to assure  the   QoS required by    applications and the  latter is  usually
unprepared for  periods of QoS   degradation.  This work introduces the  QoS
Management Environment (QoSME) that provides mechanisms for such adaptation.

The main contributions of this thesis are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Language level abstractions for QoS management. The Quality Assurance
Language (QuAL) in QoSME enables the specification of how to allocate,
monitor, analyze, and adapt to delivered QoS. Applications can express in QuAL

their QoS needs and how to handle potential violations.

\item  Automatic QoS monitoring.  QoSME automatically generates  the
instrumentation to monitor QoS when applications use QuAL constructs.  The
QoSME runtime scrutinizes interactions among applications, transport
protocols, and Operating Systems (OS)  and  collects in  QoS Management
Information Bases (MIBs) statistics on the QoS delivered.

\item  Integration of QoS and standard network management. A Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP) agent embedded in QoSME provides  QoS MIB access to

SNMP managers.  The latter can use this feature  to monitor end-to-end QoS
delivery and adapt network resource allocation and operations accordingly.

\end{itemize}

A partial prototype of QoSME has been released for public access. It runs on
SunOS 4.3  and  Solaris 2.3   and supports  communication  on ATM adaptation
layer, ST-II, UDP/IP, TCP/IP, and Unix internal protocols.

belonging to the largest eigenvalue of a symmetric positive definite matrix
by the power method. We assume that the starting
vector is randomly chosen with uniform distribution over the unit sphere.

This paper provides lower and upper as well as asymptotic bounds on the
randomized error in the ${\cal L}_p$ sense, $p\in[1,+\infty]$.
We prove that it is impossible to achieve bounds that are independent
of the ratio between the two largest eigenvalues.
This should be contrasted to the problem of
approximating the largest eigenvalue for
which Kuczy\&#039;nski and Wo\&#039;zniakowski in 1992 proved that
it is possible to bound the randomized error at the $k$-th step
with a quantity that depends only on $k$ and on the size of the matrix.

We prove that the rate of convergence depends on the ratio of the two
largest eigenvalues, on their multiplicities, and on the particular
norm. The rate of convergence is at most linear in the ratio of the
two largest eigenvalues.

The error recovery method is based on a simple fixed set of movements which
is triggered by the navigator&#039;s local observation. Alternately described,
this work characterizes those environments in which robust topological
navigation is possible, including those landmarks which, literally, ``can&#039;t

Instead we supply the navigator with qualitative information.  Our

enables the navigator to move reliably into a homogeneous space,
based on shapes formed by visible landmarks that are robust to
positional and orientational errors. Reliability
measures of parkway and trajectory traversals are defined by appropriate
error models that account for the sensory errors of the navigator, the
motor errors of the navigator, and the population of neighboring

into the generated path. The optimal path is further
abstracted into a ``custom map,&#039;&#039; which consists of a list of verbal
directional instructions, the vocabulary of which is defined by our
environmental description language.  Based on the custom map generated by
the map-maker, the navigating robot looks for events that are characterized
by spatial properties of the environment.  The map-maker and the
navigator are implemented using two cameras, an IBM 7575 robot arm
and PIPE (Pipelined Image Processing Engine.) Various experiments
show the effectiveness of navigation ``in the large&#039;&#039; using the

tool enveloping, in the context of the Oz Process Centered Environment.
This new part of the system would be complementary to the already existing
Black Box protocol for Oz and would deal with additional families of tools, 
whose character would be better serviced by a different approach, providing 
enhanced flexibility and a greater amount of interaction between the human 
operator, the tools and the environment during the execution of
the wrapped activities. To achieve this, the concepts of persistent tool 
platforms, tool sessions and transaction-like activities will be introduced
as the main innovative features of the protocol. We plan to be able 
to encapsulate and service conveniently classes of tools such as
interpretive systems, databases, medium and large size applications that allow
for incremental binding of parameters and partial retrieving of results, 
and possibly multi-user tools. Marginal modification and upgrading 
of the Oz general architecture and components will necessarily be performed.

software development process in the form of rules, each representing a
process step with its prerequisites and consequences.  @marvel enforced
that prerequisites were satisfied and used backward and forward chaining
over the rule base to automate tool invocations.  In order to support
multiple users, the process engine ensured atomicity of those rule chains
annotated as transactions.  It has recently become clear, however, that
these three modes of process assistance are not sufficient for all projects
and all users.  Guidance to users regarding the process steps they can
perform, monitoring of divergences from the prerequisites and consequences
of a process, delegation of process steps to other users, collaboration
among multiple users working together on a step (or a process fragment),
planning of a process in advance, simulation of processes for training or
analysis purposes, and instrumentation of processes for statistics
gathering may also be desirable, and there are probably other modes that we
haven&#039;t considered. Yet neither @marvel nor any other existing PCE supports
more than a handful of built-in process assistance modes. We present the
design of the new @amber system, which will generalize @marvel and other
rule-based PCEs to support enforcement, automation, atomicity, guidance,
monitoring, delegation, collaboration, planning, simulation,
instrumentation and potentially other applications.  In particular, @amber
will be fully knowledge-based, tailored by knowledge regarding the
@i(process assistance policies) to be supported as well as the @i(process

network design problems which is particularly well suited to lightwave
networks.  The lower bound can be computed in time polynomial in the network
size.  Consequently, the results in this work yields a tool which can be used
in (i) evaluating the quality of heuristic design algorithms, and (ii)
determining a termination criteria during minimization.

More specifically, given $N$ stations each with at most $d$ transceivers, and
pairwise average traffic values of the stations, the method provides a lower
bound for the combined problem of finding optimum (i) allocation of
wavelengths to the stations (configuration), and (ii) routing of the traffic
on this configuration while minimizing {\em congestion} (i.e. minimizing the
maximum flow on any link).

The lower bound computation is based on first building {\em flow
trees} to find a lower bound on the total flow, and then distributing
the total flow over the links to minimize the congestion.

                    <td class="col-md-2">Distributed  multimedia  applications  are  sensitive  to  the
Quality   of   Services   (QoS)  provided   by   their  computing  and
communication  environment. For  example, scheduling  of  processing
activities or network queueing delays  may cause excessive jitter in a
speech stream,  rendering  it difficult  to  understand.  It  is  thus
important to  establish effective technologies  to ensure  delivery of
QoS required by distributed multimedia applications.
        This proposal  presents  a new language for the development of
distributed   multimedia  applications:   Quality  Assurance  Language
(QuAL). QuAL abstractions allow the specification of QoS constraints
expected from the  underlying computing and communication environment.
QuAL specifications are compiled into run time components that monitor
the actual QoS delivered. Upon QoS  violations, application provided
exception  handlers  are  signaled to  act  upon  the  faulty  events.
Language   level  abstractions  of  QoS  shelter  programs   from  the
heterogeneity  of  underlying  infrastructures.  This  simplifies  the
development and maintenance of  multimedia applications and promotes
their portability  and reuse. QuAL generates  Management Information
Bases  (MIBs) that  contain QoS statistics per application.  Such MIBs
may  be  used to  integrate  application  level  QoS  management  into
standard network management frameworks.

becomes even worse if the code is concomitantly being modified.  For the
past two years, we have been using the Marvel process centered environment
(PCE) for all of our software development and are currently using it to
develop the Oz PCE (Marvel&#039;s successor).  Towards this effort, we are
reengineering Oz&#039;s code base to isolate the process engine, transaction
manager, and object management system as separate components that can be
mixed and matched in arbitrary systems.  In this paper, we show how a PCE
can guide and assist teams of users in carrying out code reengineering
while allowing them to continue their normal code development.  The key
features to this approach are its incremental nature and the ability of the
PCE to automate most of the tasks necessary to maintain the consistency of
the code base.

into the hypercube and the circulant networks such that each virtual
ring is hamiltonian, and the rings are mutually edge-disjoint.  It is
shown that multiple virtual rings improve (i) the bound on the length
of routing, and (ii) the fault tolerance.
 The hamiltonian virtual rings are studied on the hypercube and the
circulant graphs.  On the circulant graphs, necessary and sufficient
conditions for hamiltonian decomposition is established.  On the
hypercube three algorithms are designed for an hypercube
with even dimension: (i) an O(N) time algorithm to find two
edge-disjoint hamiltonian circuits, (ii) an $O(N \log N)$ time
algorithm to find $\frac{\log N}{2}$ hamiltonian circuits with only
epsilon leq $0.1$ common edges, and (iii) a recursive algorithm for
the hamiltonian decomposition of the hypercube with dimension power of
two.
 The routing algorithm on multiple virtual rings is 
which combines the actual routing decision with the internal
flow control state. It is shown analytically, and verified by
simulations on the circulants that with the d virtual ring
embeddings, a bound of O(N/d) is established on the maximum length of
routing.

semijoin variants, and its effect on distributed query processing
performance.  We then focus on one particular distributed query
processing algorithm, called the ``one-shot&#039;&#039; algorithm.  We modify
the one-shot algorithm by using 2SJ++ and demonstrate the improvements
achieved in network transmission cost compared with the original
one-shot technique.  We use this improvement to demonstrate that
equipped with the 2SJ++ technique, one can improve the performance of
distributed query processing algorithms significantly without adding
much complexity to the algorithms.

Our task is to compute $H^m$-norm $\e$-approximations to solutions of
$2m$th-order elliptic boundary-value problems $Lu=f$ for a fixed~$L$
and for $f\in F$.  We assume that the only information we can compute
about $f\in F$ is the value of a finite number of continuous linear
functionals of~$f$, each evaluation having cost~$c(d)$.  Previous work
has assumed that $F$ was the unit ball of a Sobolev space $H^r$ of fixed
smoothness~$r$, and it was found that the complexity of computing an
$\e$-approximation was $\comp(\e,d)=\Theta(c(d)(1/\e)^{d/(r+m)})$.
Since the exponent of $1/\e$ depends on~$d$, we see that the problem
is intractable in~$1/\e$ for any such $F$ of fixed smoothness~$r$.  In
this paper, we ask whether we can break intractability by letting $F$
be the unit ball of a space of infinite smoothness.  To be specific,
we let $F$ be the unit ball of a Hardy space of analytic functions
defined over a complex $d$-dimensional ball of radius greater than
one.  We then show that the problem is tractable in~$1/\e$.  More
precisely, we prove that $\comp(\e,d)=\Theta(c(d)(\ln 1/\e)^d)$, where
the $\Theta$-constant depends on~$d$.  Since for any $p&gt;0$, there is a
function $K(\cdot)$ such that $\comp(\e,d)\le c(d) K(d)(1/\e)^p$ for
sufficiently small~$\e$, we see that the problem is tractable, with
(minimal) exponent~$0$.  Furthermore, we show how to construct a
finite element $p$-method (in the sense of Babu\u{s}ka) that can
compute an $\e$-approximation with cost $\Theta(c(d)(\ln 1/\e)^d)$.
Hence this finite element method is a nearly optimal complexity
algorithm for $d$-dimensional elliptic problems with analytic data.

Loosely-synchronous  Transfer Mode  (LTM). LTM  operates  by signaling
periphery nodes when destinations become available. No frame structure
is imposed by LTM, thus avoiding  adaptation layers. Additionally, LTM
can  deliver  a  spectrum  of  guaranteed  quality  of  services.  New
Synchronous Protocol Stacks (SPSs) build on LTM by synchronizing their
activities to LTM  signals. Such signals can  be delivered directly to
applications  that  may  synchronize its operations  to transmissions,
thus minimizing buffering due to synchronization mismatches. SPSs  can
use current  transport protocols  unchanged  and, potentially, enhance
them with the real-time capabilities made possible through LTM.

  dividing the reponsibility of services into separate components.  It is
  still an unresolved issue, however, how a system can be created from a
  set of existing (independently developed) components.  This issue of
  integration is of immense concern to software architects since a proper
  solution would reduce duplicate implementation efforts and promote
  component reuse.  In this paper we take a step towards this goal within
  the domain of software development environments (SDEs) by showing how to
  integrate an external concurrency control component, called PERN, with an
  environment framework.  We discuss two experiments of integrating PERN
  with OZ, a decentralized process centered environment, and ProcessWEAVER,
  a commercial process server.  We introduce an architecture for
  retrofitting an external concurrency control component into an
  environment.

abstractions allow the specification of Quality of Service (QoS)

components that monitor the actual QoS delivered. Upon QoS violations,
application provided exception handlers are signaled to act upon the
faulty events. Language level abstractions of QoS shelter programs
from the heterogeneity of underlying infrastructures. This simplifies
the development and maintenance of mul- timedia applications and
promotes their portability and reuse. QuAL generates Management
Information Bases (MIBs) that contain QoS statistics per application.
Such MIBs may be used to integrate application level QoS management

                    <td class="col-md-2">High-dimensional integrals are usually solved with Monte Carlo
algorithms although theory suggests that low discrepancy algorithms
are sometimes superior.  We report on numerical testing which compares
low discrepancy and Monte Carlo algorithms on the evaluation of
financial derivatives. The testing is performed on a Collateralized
Mortgage Obligation (CMO) which is formulated as the computation of
ten integrals of dimension up to 360.

We tested two low discrepancy algorithms (Sobol and Halton) and two
randomized algorithms (classical Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo combined
with antithetic variables). We conclude that for this CMO the Sobol
algorithm is always superior to the other algorithms. We believe that
it will be advantageous to use the Sobol algorithm for many other
types of financial derivatives.

Our conclusion regarding the superiority of the Sobol algorithm also
holds when a rather small number of sample points are used, an
important case in practice.

We built a software system which runs on a network of heterogeneous
workstations under PVM 3.2 (Parallel Virtual Machine). Since
workstations are ubiquitous, this is a cost-effective way to do very
large computations fast.  The measured speedup is at least .9N for N
workstations, $N \leq 25$. The software can also be used to compute high
dimensional integrals on a single workstation.

rule  programs  against  a disk resident database.  They occupy a
position intermediate between  active  and  deductive  databases,
with  respect  to the level of abstraction of the underlying rule
language.  The operational semantics of the rule language  influ-
ences the problem solving strategy, while the architecture of the
processing environment determines efficiency and scalability.

In this paper, we present elements of the PARADISER  architecture
and its kernel rule language, PARULEL.  The PARADISER environment
provides support for parallel and distributed evaluation of  rule
programs,  as well as static and dynamic load balancing protocols
that predictively balance a computation at runtime.  This  combi-
nation  of  features results in a scalable database rule and com-
plex query processing architecture. We  validate  our  claims  by
analyzing  the  performance  of the system for two realistic test

implementation of transitive closure is significantly improved by
predictive dynamic load balancing.

additional families of tools, whose character prevents a thoroughly

address interpretive and query systems, multi-user collaborative and

of parameters after start-up and storing of intermediate and/or
partial results.  Our goal is to support a greater amount of
interaction between multiple human operators, the tools and the

introduced several concepts related to integration of Commercial
Off-The-Shelf tools into Software Development Environments: an
approach based on multiple enveloping protocols, a categorization of
tools according to their multi-tasking and multi-user capabilities,
the ideas of loose wrapping (as opposed to the usual tight wrapping)
and of persistent tools (with respect to the duration of a single
task), and a functional extension of some intrinsically single-user
applications to a (limited) form of collaboration.

                    <td class="col-md-2">The problem of accurate depth estimation using stereo
in the presence of specular reflection is addressed. Specular
reflection is viewpoint dependent and can cause large intensity
differences at corresponding points.
Hence, mismatches could result causing significant depth errors.
Current stereo algorithms largely ignore specular reflection
which is a fundamental reflection phenomenon from surfaces, both
smooth and rough. We analyzed the physics of specular reflection
and the geometry of stereopsis which led us to an interesting
relationship between stereo vergence, surface roughness, and the
likelihood of a correct match. Given the lower bound on
surface roughness, an optimal binocular stereo configuration
can be determined which maximizes precision in depth
estimation despite specular reflection.
However, surface roughness is difficult to estimate in unstructured 
environments. Therefore, multiple view configurations independent 
of surface roughness are determined such that at each scene point 
visible to all sensors, at least one stereo pair provides a correct 
depth estimate. We have developed a simple algorithm to reconstruct 
depth from the multiple view images. Experiments with real surfaces confirm the
viability of our approach. A key feature of this approach is that we do not
seek to eliminate or avoid specular reflection, but rather minimize its
effect on stereo matching.

                    <td class="col-md-2">Much of the research in inductive learning concentrates on problems
with relatively small amounts of training data.  With the steady
progress of the Human Genome Project, it is likely that orders of
magnitude more data in sequence databases will be available in the
near future for various learning problems of biological importance.
Thus, techniques that provide the means of {\it scaling} machine
learning algorithms requires considerable attention.

{\it Meta-learning} is proposed as a general technique to integrate a
number of distinct learning processes that aims to provide a means of
scaling to large problems.  This paper details several meta-learning
strategies for integrating independently learned classifiers on
subsets of training data by the same learner in a parallel and
distributed computing environment.  Our strategies are particularly
suited for massive amounts of data that main-memory-based learning
algorithms cannot handle efficiently.  The strategies are also
independent of the particular learning algorithm used and the
underlying parallel and distributed platform.  Preliminary experiments
using different learning algorithms in a simulated parallel
environment demonstrate encouraging results: parallel learning by
meta-learning can achieve comparable prediction accuracy in less space
and time than serial learning.

Some novel techniques for  elimination and avoidance of
potential transient and steady state essential hazards 
under unbounded delay assumption are proposed and
exploited in our algorithm.  This paper illustrates that apparent steady state
essential hazards can be removed from a flow table if at least two of
the rows which contribute to the hazard can be merged. It also shows
that the existing state merging algorithms introduce steady state and
transient essential hazards that can be avoided.  The algorithm has
been implemented and applied to over a dozen asynchronous sequential
machines. Results are compared with results of
non-essential-hazard-free method SIS.  Most of the tested cases can be
reduced to essential hazard free flow tables.

short natural language paragraph has a wide range of real-world applications. 
However, this specific task raises a number of difficult issues that are quite 
distinct from the generic task of language generation: conciseness, complex 
sentences, floating concepts, historical background, paraphrasing power and 
implicit content.

In this thesis, I address these specific issues by proposing a new generation 
model in which a first pass builds a draft containing only the essential new 
facts to report and a second pass incrementally revises this draft to 
opportunistically add as many background facts as can fit within the space 
limit. This model requires a new type of linguistic knowledge: revision 
operations, which specifyies the various ways a draft can be transformed in 
order to concisely accommodate a new piece of information. I present an 
in-depth corpus analysis of human-written sports summaries that resulted
in an extensive set of such revision operations. I also present the 
implementation,based on functional unification grammars, of the system STREAK, 
which relies on these operations to incrementally generate complex sentences 
summarizing basketball games. This thesis also contains two quantitative 
evaluations. The first shows that the new revision-based generation model 
is far more robust than the one-shot model of previous generators. The second 
evaluation demonstrates that the revision operations acquired during the corpus
analysis and implemented in STREAK are, for the most part, portable to at least
one other quantitative domain (the stock market).

STREAK is the first report generator that systematically places the facts which
it summarizes in their historical perspective. It is more concise than previous
systems thanks to its ability to generate more complex sentences and to 
opportunistically convey facts by adding a few words to carefully chosen draft 
constituents. The revision operations on which STREAK is based constitute the 
first set of corpus-based linguistic knowledge geared towards incremental 
generation. The evaluation presented in this thesis is also the first attempt 
to quantitatively assess the robustness of a new generation model and the 
portability of a new type of linguistic knowledge.

is that the metaclass supports  {\it  shadow}  objects that  implement
{\it secondary behaviors} of objects.  The  behavior of  an object can
be extended by dynamically composing multiple secondary behaviors with
the primary behavior of the object which  is defined by its class. The
mechanism  is referred to as  {\it dynamic composition}.  Our focus is
to  study the language architecture with which programmers are able to
construct -- without modifying the language internals --  new language
features in a high-level  and efficient  way. We demonstrate that the
MeldC  reflective  architecture  is  the  right  approach to  building
distributed and persistent systems.

three kinds of transitive closure programs, one using a stored
procedure to simulate a built-in transitive closure operator, one
using the C language embedded with SQL statements to simulate the
iterated execution of the transitive closure operation, and one using
Floyd&#039;s matrix algorithm to compute the transitive closure of an input
graph.  By comparing and analyzing the respective performances of
their different versions in terms of elapsed time spent on taking the
transitive closure, we identify some of the bottlenecks that arise
when defining the transitive closure operator on top of existing
relational systems. The main purpose of the work is to estimate the
costs of taking transitive closures on top of relational systems,
isolate the different cost factors (such as logging, network
transmission cost, etc.), and identify some necessary enhancements to
existing relational systems in order to support transitive closure
operation efficiently.  We argue that relational databases should be
augmented with efficient transitive closure operators if such queries

crep achieves this facilitation by offering the user a simple

between logical and physical topology in Wavelength Division
Multiplexing (WDM) based local and metropolitan lightwave networks.

  This paper suggests logical embeddings of digraphs into multihop lightwave
networks to maximize the throughput under nonuniform traffic
conditions.

 Defining {\it congestion} as the maximum flow carried on any link, two
perturbation heuristics are presented to find a {\it good logical}
embedding on which the routing problem is solved with minimum congestion.


  A constructive proof for a lower bound of the problem is given, and
obtaining an optimal solution for integral routing is shown to be
NP-Complete.


   The performance of the heuristics is empirically analyzed on various
traffic models.  Simulation results show that our heuristics perform, on
the average, $20\%$ from a computed lower bound. Since this lower bound is
not quite tight, we suspect that the actual performance is better. In
addition, we show that $5\% - 20\%$ performance improvements can be
obtained over the previous work.

                    <td class="col-md-2">Previous work on the $\e$-complexity of elliptic boundary-value problems
$Lu=f$ assumed that the class~$F$ of problem elements~$f$ was the unit
ball of a Sobolev space.  In a recent paper, we considered the case
of a model two-point boundary-value problem,
with $F$ being a class of analytic functions.  In this paper, we ask
what happens if $F$ is a class of piecewise analytic functions.  We
find that the complexity depends strongly on how much a priori
information we have about the breakpoints.  If the location of the
breakpoints is known, then the $\e$-complexity is proportional to
$\ln(\e^{-1})$, and there is a finite element $p$-method (in the sense
of Babu\u{s}ka) whose cost is optimal to within a constant factor.
If we know neither the location nor the number of breakpoints, then
the problem is unsolvable for $\e&lt;\sqrt{2}$.  If we know only that
there are $b\ge 2$ breakpoints, but we don&#039;t know their location, then
the $\e$-complexity is proportional to $b\e^{-1}$, and a finite element
$h$-method is nearly optimal.  In short, knowing the location of the
breakpoints is as good as knowing that the problem elements are
analytic, whereas only knowing the number of breakpoints is no better
than knowing that the problem elements have a bounded derivative in
the $L_2$ sense.

processing power within switches to  support Gbit/s transmission rates
available  today.  These  techniques anchor  their  decision-making on
control information within transmitted frames and  thus  must  resolve
routes at the speed in which frames are being pumped into switches.

Isochronets can potentially  switch at any transmission rate by making
switching decisions independent of frame contents.  Isochronets divide
network  bandwidth among  routing  trees,  a  technique  called  Route
Division  Multiple  Access (RDMA).   Frames  access  network resources
through  the  appropriate  routing tree  to  the  destination.   Frame
structures  are  irrelevant  for  switching  decisions.  Consequently,
Isochronets can support multiple framing protocols without  adaptation
layers and are strong candidates for all-optical implementations.  All
network-layer functions  are reduced to an admission control mechanism
designed  to provide quality of service (QOS) guarantees for  multiple
classes of traffic.

The main results of this work are:

(1)  A new network architecture suitable for high-speed transmissions;

(2)  An  implementation  of  Isochronets  using  cheap   off-the-shelf
     components;

(3)  A comparison of RDMA  with more traditional switching techniques,
     such as Packet Switching and Circuit Switching;

(4)  New protocols necessary for Isochronet operations; and

(5)  Use  of Isochronet techniques at higher  layers  of  the protocol
     stack (in particular, we show how Isochronet techniques may solve
     routing problems in ATM networks).

This registration process is defined and executed using the same

process.  Each remote site is represented by a root object in the
distributed objectbase containing the software under development; each
local subobjectbase can be displayed and queried at any site, but only
its root is physically copied at every site.  Everything described in

difficult.  This doctoral thesis introduces five example-based
techniques to facilitate the process. These techniques are
independently useful, but also interrelate in interesting ways:

* Graphical Search and Replace, the analogue to textual search and
replace in text editors, is useful for making repetitive changes
throughout graphical documents.

* Constraint-Based Search and Replace, an extension to graphical
search and replace, allows users to define their own illustration
beautification rules and constraint inferencing rules by
demonstration.

* Constraint Inferencing from Multiple Snapshots facilitates
constraint specification by automatically computing constraints that
hold in multiple configurations of an illustration.

* Editable Graphical Histories, a visual representation of commands in
a graphical user interface, are useful for reviewing, undoing, and
redoing sets of operations.

* Graphical Macros By Example, based on this history representation,
allow users to scroll through previously executed commands and
encapsulate useful sequences into macros. These macros can be
generalized into procedures, with arguments and flow of control using
graphical and constraint-based search and replace.

Individually and in combination, these techniques reduce repetition in
graphical editing tasks, visually and by example, using the
application&#039;s own interface. These techniques have been implemented in
Chimera, an editor built to serve as a testbed for this research.

in kinds of conventional control flow model of execution which is 
limited by &quot;von Neumann bottleneck.&quot; In this paper we propose a new 
multiprocessor dataflow machine, called DFLOPS, for parallel processing
of production systems. The rules programs are compiled into dataflow 
graphs and then map into DFLOPS processing elements. Our parallel 
execution model exploits not only matching rules in parallel but also  
firing rules in parallel. The design and implementation of  DFLOPS is 
presented in detail. The distinguishing characteristics of this proposed 
machine lies in its  simplicity, fully-pipelined processing and  fine 
grain parallelism. MISD, SIMD and/or MIMD modes of execution can be 
exploited in this machine according to the properties of applications.
The initial results reveal that the performance of production systems is
greatly improved.

central project database and file repository, accessible to a
programmer&#039;s workstation via a local area network connection.  The
introduction of powerful mobile computers has demonstrated the need
for a new model, which allows for machines with transient network
connectivity to assist programmers in product development.  We propose
a process-based checkout model by which process and product files that
may be needed during a planned period of dis-connectivity are
pre-fetched with minimal user effort.  Rather than selecting each file
by hand, which is tedious and error-prone, the user only informs the
environment of the portion of the software development process
intended to be executed while disconnected.  The environment is then
responsible for pre-fetching the necessary files.  We hope that this
approach will enable programmers to continue working on a project
without network access.

                    <td class="col-md-2">Terminological systems in the tradition of KL-ONE are widely used in AI to
represent and reason with concept descriptions.  They compute subsumption
relations between concepts and automatically classify concepts into a
taxonomy having well-founded semantics.  Each concept in the taxonomy
describes a set of possible instances which are a superset of those
described by its descendants.  One limitation of current systems is their
inability to handle complex compositions of concepts, such as constraint
networks where each node is described by an associated concept.  For
example, plans are often represented (in part) as collections of actions
related by a rich variety of temporal and other constraints.  The T-REX
system integrates terminological reasoning with constraint network
reasoning to classify such plans, producing a ``terminological&#039;&#039; plan
library.  T-REX also introduces a new theory of plan recognition as a
deductive process which dynamically partitions the plan library by
modalities, e.g., necessary, possible and impossible, while observations
are made.  Plan recognition is guided by the plan library&#039;s terminological
nature.  Varying assumptions about the accuracy and monotonicity of the
observations are addressed.  Although this work focuses on temporal
constraint networks used to represent plans, terminological systems can be
extended to encompass constraint networks in other domains as well.

due to timing problems are considered.  These are hazards, critical

common to all forms of hazards and to metastable states.  A similar
mechanism, with added complications, is shown to characterize critical
races.  Means for defeating various types of hazards and critical
races through the use of one-sided delay constraints are introduced.
A method is described for determining from a flow table situations in
which metastable states may be entered.  A circuit technique for
defeating metastability problems in self timed systems is presented.
It is shown that the use of simulation for verifying the correctness
of a circuit with given bounds on the branch delays cannot be relied
upon to expose all timing problems. An example is presented that
refutes the conjecture that replacing pure delays with inertial delays
can only eliminate glitches.</td>

We count the number of particular sets of faulty
processing elements. We show that
the number of catastrophic faults of $g$ elements
is equal to the $(g-1)$-th Catalan number.
We also provide algorithms to 
rank and unrank all catastrophic sets of $g$ faults.
Finally, we describe a linear time algorithm that generates all

a Responder chooses an element $x$ in $\{ 1,2,\ldots,1000000 \}$
unknown to a Questioner. The Questioner has to find
it by asking queries of the form ``$x \in Q ?$&quot;, where $Q$ is an
arbitrary subset of $\{ 1,2,\ldots, 1000000 \}$. The Responder provides
``yes&quot; or ``no&quot; answers, some of which may be {\it erroneous }.

                    <td class="col-md-2">There is a strong trend toward the production of small ``notebook&#039;&#039;
computers.  The small size of portable computers places inherent
limits on their storage capacity, making remote paging desirable or
necessary.  Further, mobile computers can ``walk away from&#039;&#039; their
servers, increasing load on network routing resources and/or breaking
network connections altogether.  Therefore, it is desirable to allow
client-server matchups to be made dynamically and to vary over time,
so that a client might always be connected to nearby servers.
Accordingly, we have built a self-organizing paging service that
adapts to changes in locale and that stores pages in remote memory if
possible.  We show empirically that there is no performance penalty
for using our paging facility instead of a local disk.  This suggests
that portable computers need neither a hard disk nor an excessive
amount of RAM, provided that they will operate in environments in
which remote storage is plentiful.  These are important facts because
both a hard disk and large amounts of RAM are undesirable
characteristics for very small portable computers.</td>

physical location changes with time. Such hosts cannot depend on
traditional forms of network connectivity and routing because their
location, and hence the route to reach them, cannot be deduced from
their IP address. We present protocols that seamlessly integrate
mobile hosts into the current IP networking infrastructure. They are
primarily targeted at supporting a campus environment with mobile
computers, but also extend gracefully to accomodate hosts moving
between different networks. The key feature is the dependence on
ancillary machines to track the location of the mobile hosts.  Our
protocols are designed to react quickly to changing topologies, to
scale well, and not to place an overwhelming burden on the network.

                    <td class="col-md-2">Many graphics tasks, such as the manipulation of graphical objects,
and the construction of user-interface widgets, can be facilitated by
geometric constraints. However, the difficulty of specify-ing
constraints by traditional methods forms a barrier to their widespread
use. In order to make constraints easier to declare, we have developed
a method of specifying constraints implicitly, through multiple
examples. Snapshots are taken of an initial scene configuration, and
one or more additional snapshots are taken after the scene has been
edited into other valid configurations. The constraints that are
satisfied in all the snapshots are then applied to the scene objects.
We discuss an efficient algorithm for inferring constraints from
multiple snapshots. The algorithm has been incorporated into the
Chimera editor, and several examples of its use are discussed.

steps in a software process. One of the major objectives of this
research is to invoke external tools to carry out steps in a software
process without modifying the tools. This is achieved by encapsulating
tools in {\it envelopes}, designed to abstract the details of a tool
from the {\sc Marvel} kernel, thereby providing a ``black box&#039;&#039;
interface.  Initially we used the {\sc Unix} shell script language to
write envelopes.  However, due to several limitations of the shell
language the black box abstraction could not be fully supported.  We
describe these limitations and discuss how we extended the shell
language to obtain a new envelope language that fully supports the
black box abstraction.

to trace sequential and parallel execution of a program.  Associated
with each DPE are actions that allow access to useful trace variables
and I/O facilities.  DPEs are useful for describing sequential and
concurrent patterns of events to be verified during execution.  The 
patterns include conditions such as synchronizations, race conditions,

software development activity in a rule that specifies the condition for
invoking the activity and its effects on the components of the project
under development.  These components are abstracted as objects and stored
in a persistent object database.  Each rule applies to a specific class of
objects, which is specified as the parameter of the rule.  Firing a rule
entails binding its formal parameter to a specific object. If the rule
changes the object in such a way that the conditions of other rules become
satisfied, these other rules are automatically fired.  A problem arises in
this forward chaining model when the classes of the objects manipulated by
the rules are different.  {\sc Marvel} has to determine which object to
bind to the parameter of each rule in the chain, based on the object
manipulated by the original rule that initiated the chain.  We describe a
heuristic approach for solving this problem in the current {\sc Marvel}
implementation and introduce an algorithmic approach that does better.

                      Incremental Attribute Evaluation for Multi-User Semantics-Based Editors

                    <td class="col-md-2">This thesis addresses two fundamental problems associated with
performing incremental attribute evaluation in multi-user editors
based on the attribute grammar formalism: (1) multiple asynchronous
modifications of the attributed derivation tree, and (2) segmentation
of the tree into separate modular units.  Solutions to these problems
make it possible to construct semantics-based editors for use by teams
of programmers developing or maintaining large software systems.
Multi-user semantics-based editors improve software productivity by
reducing communication costs and snafus.

The objectives of an incremental attribute evaluation algorithm for
multiple asynchronous changes are that (a) all attributes of the
derivation tree have correct values when evaluation terminates, and
(b) the cost of evaluating attributes necessary to reestablish a
correctly attributed derivation tree is minimized.  We present a family
of algorithms that differ in how they balance the tradeoff between
algorithm efficiency and expressiveness of the attribute grammar.
This is important because multi-user editors seem a practical basis
for many areas of computer-supported cooperative work, not just
programming.  Different application areas may have distinct
definitions of efficiency, and may impose different requirements on
the expressiveness of the attribute grammar.  The characteristics of
the application domain can then be used to select the most efficient
strategy for each particular editor.

To address the second problem, we define an extension of classical
attribute grammars that allows the specification of interface
consistency checking for programs composed of many modules. Classical
attribute grammars can specify the static semantics of monolithic programs or
modules, but not inter-module semantics; the latter was done in the
past using @i[ad hoc] techniques.  Extended attribute grammars support 
programming-in-the-large constructs found in real programming
languages, including textual inclusion, multiple kinds of modular
units and nested modular units.  We discuss attribute evaluation in the
context of programming-in-the-large, particularly the separation of
concerns between the local evaluator for each modular unit and the
global evaluator that propagates attribute flows across module
boundaries. The result is a uniform approach to formal specification
of both intra-module and inter-module static semantic properties, with
the ability to use attribute evaluation algorithms to carry out a
complete static semantic analysis of a multi-module program.

OODB but provides a general purpose concurrent object oriented
programming language as well, sharing the object base with the OODB
query facilities.  In this paper, we will define several different
types of object systems (object servers, persistent OOPL&#039;s, OODB&#039;s and
OMS&#039;s) in terms of their interfaces and capabilities.  We will examine
the distinguishing features and general architecture of systems of
each type in the light of a general model of OMS architecture.

clients, and we present our solution: a lazy ``server-based&#039;&#039; update
operation.  This operation facilitates fast, scalable, and highly
fault-tolerant implementations of both read and write operations in
the usual case.  To cope with the weak semantics of the update
operation, we propose a new file system service interface that allows
applications to opt for ``UNIX semantics&#039;&#039; by use of a slower, less
fault-tolerant read operation.

application is running, but changes are usually limited to adding new
client and server processes and changing the bindings among such
processes.  In some application domains, such as real-time financial
services, it is necessary to support finer grained reconfiguration at
the level of entities smaller than processes, but desirable to reduce
the overhead associated with ad hoc dynamic storage allocation.  We
present a scheme for special cases of fine-grained dynamic
reconfiguration sufficient for our application domain and show how it
can be used for practical changes.  We introduce new language concepts
to apply this scheme in the context of an object-based programming
language that supports shared data in a distributed environment.

SPLENDORS allows great flexibility in creating portfolio managers for

                    <td class="col-md-2">CLASP (ClAssification of Scenarios and Plans) is a knowledge representation
system that extends the notion of subsumption from frame-based languages to
plans.  The CLASP representation language provides description forming
operators that specify temporal and conditional relationships between actions
represented in CLASSIC (a current subsumption-based knowledge representation
language).  CLASP supports subsumption inferences between plan concepts and
other plan concepts, as well as between plan concepts and plan instances. 
These inferences support the automatic creation of a plan taxonomy. 
Subsumption in CLASP builds on term subsumption in CLASSIC and illustrates
how term subsumption can be exploited to serve special needs.  In particular,
the CLASP algorithms for plan subsumption integrate work in automata theory
with work in term subsumption.  We are using CLASP to store and retrieve
information about feature specifications and test scripts in the context of a
large software development project.

generator program that uses the technique of unification grammars. The
program is composed of two main modules: a unifier and a linearizer. The
unifier takes as input a semantic description of the text to be generated
and a unification grammar, and produces as output a rich syntactic
description of the text. The linearizer interprets this syntactic
description and produces an English sentence. 

This manual includes a detailed presentation of the technique of
unification grammars and a reference manual for the current implementation
(FUF 5.0).  Version 5.0 now includes novel techniques in the unification
allowing the specification of types and the expression of complete
information.  It also allows for procedural unification and supports
sophisticated forms of control.

                    <td class="col-md-2">Cue phrases are linguistic expressions such as @i(now) and @i(well) that function as
explicit indicators of the structure of a discourse.  For example, @i(now) may
signal the beginning of a subtopic or a return to a previous topic, while
@i(well) may mark subsequent material as a response to prior material, or as an
explanatory comment.  However, while cue phrases @b(may) convey discourse
structure, each also has one or more alternate uses.  While @i(incidentally) may
be used @b(SENTENTIALLY) as an adverbial, for example, the @b(DISCOURSE) use
initiates a digression.  The question of how speakers and hearers distinguish
between discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases is rarely addressed in
discourse studies.

This paper reports results of several empirical studies of discourse and
sentential uses of cue phrases, in which both text-based and prosodic
features were examined for disambiguating power.  Based on these studies, we
propose that discourse versus sentential usage may be distinguished by
intonational features, specifically, @b(PITCH) @b(ACCENT) and @b(INTONATIONAL)
@b(PHRASING).  We identify a prosodic model that characterizes these
distinctions.  We associate this model with features identifiable from text
analysis, including orthography and part-of-speech, to permit the application
of our findings to the generation of appropriate intonational features for
discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases in synthetic speech.

There are five important dynamic programming problems which
have wide application, and that have been studied extensively
in sequential computation.  Two problems among the five have
fast parallel algorithms; almost no work has been done for
parallelizing the other three.  We give fast parallel algorithms
for four of these problems, including the three.
We use two well-known methods as general paradigms for developing
parallel algorithms.  Combined with various techniques, they
lead to a number of new results.  At the heart of our new results
is a processor reduction technique, which enables us to solve
all four problems with a fewer number of operations than that
needed for computing a matrix closure.

biologists have been analyzing chemical sequences from DNA, RNA, and
proteins.  To facilitate this process, sequence analysis knowledge has
been encoded in computer programs.  However, translating human
knowledge to programs is known to be problematic.  Machine Learning
techniques allow these systems to be generated automatically.  This
article discusses the application of learning techniques to various
analysis tasks.  It is shown that the learned systems constructed to
date are often more accurate than human-designed systems.  Moreover,
learning can form plausible new hypotheses, which potentially lead to
discovering new knowledge.

                    <td class="col-md-2">Epsilon Serializability (ESR) is a generalization of classic
serializability (SR).  ESR allows some limited amount of inconsistency
in transaction processing (TP), through an interface called
epsilon-transactions (ETs).  For example, some query ETs may view
inconsistent data due to non-SR interleaving with concurrent updates.
In this paper, we restrict our attention to the situation where
query-only ETs run concurrently with {\em consistent} update
transactions that are SR without the ETs.

This paper presents a {\em formal characterization} of ESR and ETs.
Using the ACTA framework, the first part of this characterization
formally expresses the inter-transaction conflicts that are recognized
by ESR and, through that, defines ESR, analogous to the manner in
which conflict-based serializability is defined.  The second part of
the paper is devoted to deriving expressions for: (1) the {\em
inconsistency} in the values of data -- arising from ongoing updates,
(2) the inconsistency of the results of a query -- arising from the
inconsistency of the data read in order to process the query, and (3)
the inconsistency exported by an update ET -- arising from ongoing
queries reading uncommitted data produced by the update ET.  These
expressions are used to determine the preconditions that ET operations
have to satisfy in order to maintain the limits on the inconsistency
in the data read by query ETs, the inconsistency exported by update
ETs, and the inconsistency in the results of queries.  This
determination suggests possible mechanisms that can be used to realize
ESR.

                    <td class="col-md-2">We provide a detailed overview of knowledge representation issues in
general and terminological knowledge representation in particular.
Terminological knowledge representation, which originated with KL-ONE, 
is an object-centered approach in the tradition of semantic networks and
frames.  Terminological systems share three distinguishing characteristics:
(1) They are intended to support the definition of conceptual terms
comprising a &quot;terminology&quot; and to facilitate reasoning about such terms.
As such, they are explicitly distinguished from assertional systems which
make statements of fact based on some terminology.  (2) Their concepts are
arranged in a taxonomy so that the attributes of a concept apply to its
descendants without exception.  Thus, the proper location of any concept
within the taxonomy can be uniquely determined from the concept&#039;s
definition by an automatic process known as classification.  (3) They
restrict the expressiveness of their language to achieve relatively
efficient performance.

We first survey important general issues in the field of knowledge
representation, consider the semantics of concepts and their
interrelationship, and examine the intertwined notions of taxonomy and
inheritance.  After discussing classification, we present a number of
implemented terminological systems in detail, along with several hybrid
systems which couple terminological and assertional reasoning components.
We conclude by assessing the current state of the art in terminological
knowledge representation.

of enunciation. We then distinguish between five major classes of
constraints on lexical choice: grammatical, inter-lexical, encyclopedic,

represented and used in existing generators. We conclude by pointing out
the common limitations of these generators with respect to lexical choice

be instrumented for testing.  At the heart of the method is the
systematic renaming and duplication of object classes.

nature of CSMA networks to speed up simultaneous one-to-many file
transfers (e.g., when booting diskless workstations). The CTFTP server
lisens and services request for entire files or portions thereof.
CTFTP clients first determine whether the file they are interested in
is already being transferred, in which case they ``eavesdrop&#039;&#039; and
load as much of it as they can, or they initiate a new transfer. The
clients timeout when the server stops transmitting, and if they are
still missing parts of the file they request them with a
block-transfer request. CTFTP is a back-end protocol; a front end is
needed to handle naming and security issues.

networks such as the Internet is difficult.  Many of the important
variables (path, network load, etc) cannot be controlled.  Monitoring
the entire Internet to follow individual messages is impractical.  We
developed the Layered Refinement methodology to meet these challenges.
Our method uses generic software tools to collect data simultaneously
at important software layers.  Data are analyzed and refined to reduce
variance, and correlated to give us a good understanding of each
layer.  Sample data spanning seven days illustrate the method, which
narrows the confidence interval by an order of magnitude to show the
end-to-end performance of applications that run over Internet.

the loci of camera poses and optical settings that satisfy the machine
vision task requirements of visibility, field-of-view, depth-of-field
and resolution for given features of interest.  It is important to
determine the entire admissible domain of sensor locations,
orientations, and settings for each task constraint, so that these
component results can be combined in order to find globally admissible
sensor parameter values.  This work is part of more extensive research
that we are pursuing, as part of our &quot;MVP&quot; (Machine Vision Planner)
system, on the problem of sensor planning for satisfaction of several
ge neric machine vision requirements.  When designing a vision system
that will satisfy the requirements of the machine vision task at hand,
it is necessary to properly select the specifications of the image
sensor (e.g.  pixel size), as well as decide the image sensor
placement and settings. We present techniques to determine the latter
two using a synthesis approach to the problem.  This approach provides
significant advantages over the generate-and-test techniques currently
employed, in which, sensor configurations are generated and then
tested for satisfaction of the task criteria.  Compared to the
previous papers we published on &quot;MVP&quot;, the new results presented in
this paper include techniques and implementation for determining the
constraint satisfaction loci when all degrees of freedom of camera
placement are taken into account; obtaining globally feasible sensor
configurations by posing the constraint satisfaction problem in an
optimization setting; analyzing and formulating a new constraint, that
of depth-of-field, for the determination of sensor placement and
setting that satisfy this constraint; providing a more efficient
approach to the visibility constraint; plus presenting the new test
results of the above mentioned techniques.  Camera placement
experiments are shown that demonstrate the method in an actual robotic
setup for a general three-dimensional viewing configuration.  A camera
mounted on a robotic arm is placed and set according to the results of
the new technique and camera views are taken to verify that the
features of interest are visible, within the camera field-of-view and
depth-of-field, and resolvable to the given specification.  Results of
this research will help automate the vision system design process,
assist in programming the vision system itself and lead to intelligent
automated robot imaging systems.

assistance models implemented by RBDEs.  We consider three models:
pure automation, strict consistency preservation, and a maximalist
assistance model that integrates consistency and automation.  The
choice of assistance model impacts the functionality of the RBDE, more
precisely the solutions to three problems that arise in scaling up
RBDEs: (1) multiple views; (2) evolution; and (3) concurrency control.

                    <td class="col-md-2">Although software reuse presents clear advantages for programmer
productivity and code reliability, it is not practiced enough.  One of
the reasons for the only moderate success of reuse is the lack of
software libraries that facilitate the actual locating and
understanding of reusable components.  This paper describes a technology
for automatically assembling large software libraries that
promote software reuse by helping the user locate the components
closest to her/his needs.

Software libraries are automatically assembled from a set of
unorganized components by using information retrieval techniques.
The construction of the library is done in two steps.  First,
attributes are automatically extracted from natural language
documentation by using a new indexing scheme based on the notions of
lexical affinities and quantity of information.  Then, a hierarchy for
browsing is automatically generated using a clustering technique that
draws only on the information provided by the attributes.  Thanks to
the free-text indexing scheme, tools following this  approach can
accept free-style natural  language queries.

This technology has been implemented in the {\sc Guru} system, which has
been applied to construct an organized library of {\sc Aix} utilities.
 An experiment was  conducted  in order to evaluate the retrieval
effectiveness of
{\sc Guru} as compared to {\sc InfoExplorer} a hypertext library
system for {\sc Aix} 3 on the IBM RISC System/6000 series. We followed the
usual evaluation procedure used in information retrieval, based upon
recall and precision measures, and determined that our system
performs 15\% better on a random test set,  while being much less
expensive to build than {\sc InfoExplorer</td>

are quite pronounced and can be regarded as defining working sets of
files used for particular applications.  This paper describes a
client-side cache management technique for detecting these patterns
and then exploiting them to successfully prefetch files from servers.
Trace-driven simulations show the technique substantially increases
the hit rate of a client file cache in an environment in which a
client workstation is dedicated to a single user.  Successful file
prefetching carries three major advantages: (1) applications run
faster, (2) there is less ``burst&#039;&#039; load placed on the network, and
(3) properly-loaded client caches can better survive network outages.
Our technique requires little extra code, and DASH because it is
simply an augmentation of the standard LRU client cache management
algorithm DASH is easily incorporated into existing software.

adaptive in the sense that the replication scheme of the item (i.e.
the set of processors, each of which stores a replica of the
data-item), changes as the read-write pattern of the processors in the
network changes.  The algorithm is optimal in the sense that when the
replication scheme stabilizes, the total number of messages required
for the reads and writes is minimal.  The algorithm is extremely
simple.

the inference procedure in cycles, ending with a final database.
In a real time environment it is possible to receive updates to the
initial database after the inference procedure has started or even after it 
has ended.  We present an algorithm for incremental maintenance of the 
inference database in the presence of such updates.
Interestingly, the same algorithm is useful for parallel and distributed
rule processing. When the processors evaluating a program operate
asynchronously, then they may have different {\em views} of the database.
The incremental maintenance procedure we present can be used to
synchronize these views.

definite and a demonstrative pronoun in similar contexts of use.  It
thus provides an opportunity to examine the separate contributions to
attentional state [15] of two linguistic features---definiteness and
demonstrativity---independently of pronominalization per se.  The two
pronouns, &quot;it&quot; and &quot;that&quot;, have clearly contrastive contexts of use,
explained here in terms of distinct pragmatic functions.  Certain uses
of &quot;it&quot; are claimed to perform a distinctive cohesive function, namely
to establish a &quot;local center&quot; (which modifies rather than replaces
the notion of a center).  The crucial distinction between a local
center and the Cb of the centering framework (cf. [38] [13] [14] [21])
is that there is only a single potential local center rather than an
ordered set of Cfs.  The local center is argued to constitute a
reference point in the model of the speech situation in a manner
analogous to 1st and 2nd person pronouns.  In contrast, a deictic
function is posited for apparently anaphoric uses of &quot;that&quot; whereby
the attentional status of a discourse entity is changed, or a new
discourse entity is constructed based on non-referential constituents
of the linguistic structure.  Since it is impossible to observe
attentional processes directly, I present an empirical method for
investigating discourse coherence relations. I analyze statistically
significant distributional models in terms of three types of
transitions in the cognitive states of conversational participants:
expected transitions, unexpected transitions, and transitions with no
relevant effect.

case of integer edge costs in a given range $[1\ldots C]$, we
introduce a new data structure which is able to answer queries
concerning the length of the shortest path between any two vertices in
constant time, and to trace out the shortest path between any two
vertices in time linear in the number of edges reported.  The total
time required to maintain the data structure under a sequence of at
most $O(n^2)$ edge insertions and at most $O(Cn^2)$ edge cost
decreases is $O(Cn^3\log (nC))$ in the worst case, where $n$ is the
total number of vertices in $G$.  For the case of unit edge costs, the
total time required to maintain the data structure under a sequence of
at most $O(n^2)$ insertions of edges becomes $O(n^3\log n)$ in the
worst case.  Both data structures can be adapted to solve the problem
of maintaining on-line maximal length paths in directed acyclic

                    <td class="col-md-2">This report  describes work on the problem  of generating a turn  within an
ongoing  conversation.     Three main points   are advanced:  (1)  Previous
discourse determines the form and content of a new turn; this work proposes
techniques to take the influence  of  previous  discourse into account when
generating text. (2) The connection  between previous discourse and  a  new
turn can be described  as the interaction  between five  local constraints;
local  constraints are   relations between one   discourse segment  of  the
previous discourse and the new turn.  This multi-dimensional description of
discursive  relations  allows a   flexible definition of complex rhetorical
relations.  (3) Argumentation is one  class of local constraints  which has
important  effects  on the form   of the language  produced   and interacts
closely with the other types of local constraints used in this work.

The problem of generating a turn is then posed as  the problem of finding a
set of local  constraints  compatible with each  other,  with the  previous
discourse,  and with the information  to  convey.   The  application of the
local constraints  determines  the value of pragmatic  features of  the new
turn.  A  sophisticated grammar   can then translate these  decisions  into
appropriate lexical and syntactic decisions.

The approach is applied to the implementation  of an explanation module for
the {\sc ADVISOR} expert system.  The  implementation is based on an extended
form  of functional unification; this  extended formalism  is a good choice
for handling the problem of constraint interaction.

generates text with the intent of extending user expertise in
interactive environments. Instead of generating text based solely on
either discourse goals, intentions, or the domain, we found a
need to combine techniques from each.  We have developed an object-
oriented architecture in which the concepts about which we talk
(domain entities), the goals that may be accomplished with them
(intentions), and the rhetorical acts through which we express them
(discourse goals) are represented as objects with localized knowledge
and methods. A three stage process of content selection, content
structuring and content filtering is presented. Content selection and
structuring allow us to produce text that is within the context of the
task at hand for the user.  Content filtering allows us to revise and
restructure the utterance to achieve clarity and conciseness.

                    <td class="col-md-2">This paper is concerned with the issue of parallel evaluation of logic programs.  We define the concept of ``program decomposability&#039;&#039;, which means that the load of evaluation can be partitioned among a number of
processors, without a need for communication among them.  This in turn
results in a very significant speed-up of the evaluation process.
Some programs are decomposable, whereas others are not.  We completely
syntactically characterize three classes of single rule programs with
respect to decomposability: nonrecursive, simple linear, and simple
chain programs.  We also establish two sufficient conditions for
decomposability.

                    <td class="col-md-2">We address the problem of parallelizing the evaluation of logic programs in data intensive applications.  We argue that the appropriate parallelization strategy for logic-program evaluation depends on the program being evaluated. Therefore, this paper is concerned with the issues of program-classification, and parallelization-strategies.  We propose several parallelization strategies based on the concept of data-reduction -- the original logic-program is evaluated by several processors working in parallel, each using only a subset of the database.  The strategies differ on the evaluation cost, the overhead of communication and synchronization among processors, and the programs to which they are applicable.  In
particular, we start our study with pure-parallelization, i.e., parallelization without overhead. An interesting class-structure of logic programs is demonstrated, when considering amenability to pure-parallelization.  The relationship to the NC complexity class is demonstrated.  Then we propose strategies that do incur an overhead,but are optimal in a sense that will be precisely defined. 
This paper makes the initial steps towards a theory of parallel logic-programming.

rule-based modeling of the software development process.  RBDEs store
the software artifacts in a project database, and define each software
development activity that manipulates these artifacts as a rule.
Opportunistic forward and backward chaining on the rules automates
some of chores that developers would have otherwise done manually and
ensures consistency in the database.  Existing RBDEs do not scale up
to real software development projects involving large teams of
developers, in part because the current expert system paradigm does
not handle multiple agents sharing the working memory of the rule
system. In this article, we investigate the scaling
up of RBDEs through the use of an object-oriented framework that
integrates the structural and behavioral aspects of data modeling and
rule-based process modeling.  We use this framework to support both
consistency maintenance and cooperation in multi-agent RBDEs.

                    <td class="col-md-2">In this paper we formalize and implement a model of topological
visual navigation in two-dimensional spaces.  Unlike much of
traditional quantitative visual navigation, the emphasis throughout
is on the methods and the efficiency of qualitative visual
descriptions of objects and environments, and on the methods and the
efficiency of direction-giving by means of visual landmarks.  We
formalize three domains--the world itself, the map-maker&#039;s view of
it, and the navigator&#039;s experience of it--and the concepts of custom
maps and landmarks.  We specify, for a simplified navigator (the
``level helicopter&#039;&#039;) the several ways in which visual landmarks
can be chosen, depending on which of several costs (sensor, distance,
or communication) should be minimized.  We show that paths minimizing
one measure can make others arbitrarily complex; the algorithm for
selecting the path is based on a form of Dijkstra&#039;s algorithm, and
therefore automatically generates intelligent navigator overshooting and
backtracking.  We implement, using an arm-held camera, such a
navigator, and detail its basic seek-and-adjust behaviors as it
follows visual highways (or departs from them) to reach a goal.
Seeking is based on topology, and adjusting is based on symmetry; there are
essentially no quantitative measures.  We describe under what
circumstances its environment is visually difficult and perceptively
shadowed, and describe how errors in path-following impact landmark
selection.  Since visual landmark selection and direction-giving are
in general NP-complete, and rely on the nearly intractable concept of
characteristic views, we suggest some heuristics; one is that the
landmark object ``itself&#039;&#039;, rather than its views, may be its most
compact encoding.  We conclude with speculations about the feasibility
of intelligent navigation in very large self-occluding visual worlds.

as a point that splits $E$ into two subsets of comparable

[BOT] and [BFKT] that compute such interleaving sets and splitting
points for the set of the zeros of a polynomial $p(\lambda)$ having
only real zeros. As a result, the record upper estimates for the
parallel and sequential complexity of approximating to all the zeros
of such a polynomial are obtained in an alternate way and, moreover,
are extended to the eigenvalue computation for $T_n$. Furthermore, we
dramatically decreased the previous record upper estimates for the

polylogarithmic factors from the straightforward lower bounds.

The estimates for the storage space, sequential time and the number of processors required for the computation and storage of such a recursive factorization is by almost the factor of $n$ less than the similar estimates for the Choleski factorization in the case of Toeplitz-like and Hankel-like matrices.

artifacts from one software development environment (SDE) to another
for the purpose of upgrading to new SDEs as technology improves, while
continuing development or maintenance of existing software systems.
We first taxonomize the larger problem of data migration, to
establish the scope of immigration.  We then classify SDEs in terms of
the ease of immigrating software artifacts out of the data repository
of the source SDE without knowledge of its internal representation.  A
framework is presented for constructing automatic immigration tools as
utilities provided by destination SDEs. We describe a specific
immigration tool, called Marvelizer, that we have implemented as
part of the Marvel SDE and discuss our experience using the tool.

set of variables to an equally correct program that uses another set
of variables, usually of different types.  There have been a number of
seemingly different mathematical definitions of data refinement.  We
present a unifying view of data refinement as a special case of
procedural refinement, which is simpler to understand.  All the
data refinement theories in the literature are shown to be instances
of two formulas, but we show that there are actually an infinite number
of theories.  In addition, we introduce the concepts of nonlocal data
refinement, data refinement using semi-invariants, and procedural
optimization using data refinement.

to allow real-time visual servoing of a robotic arm.  The system
consists of two calibrated cameras that provide images to a real-time,
pipelined-parallel optic-flow algorithm that can robustly compute
optic-flow and calculate the 3-D position of a moving object at
approximately 5 Hz rates.  These 3-D positions serve as input to a
predictive kinematic control algorithm that uses an $alpha~ - ~beta~ - ~gamma$
filter to update the position of a robotic arm tracking the moving
object. Experimental results are presented for the
tracking of a moving model train in a variety of different trajectories.

                    <td class="col-md-2">This paper describes a new segmentation technique for very sparse surfaces which is based on minimizing the energy of the surfaces in the scene.  While it could be used in almost any system as part of surface reconstruction/model recovery, the algorithm is designed to be usable when the depth information is scattered and very sparse, as is generally the case with depth generated by stereo algorithms.  We show results from a sequential algorithm and discuss a working prototype that executes on the massively parallel Connection Machine. The idea of segmentation by energy minimization is not new, however past techniques have relied on discrete regularization or Markov random fields to model the surfaces to build smooth surfaces and detect depth edges.  In addition, both of the aforementioned techniques are ineffective at energy minimization for very sparse data.  The technique presented herein models thesurfaces with reproducing kernel-based splines which can be shown to solve a regularized surface reconstruction problem.  From the functional form of these splines we derive computable upper and lower bounds on the energy of a surface over a given finite region.  The computation of the spline, and the corresponding surface representation are quite efficient for very sparse data. An interesting property of the algorithm is that it makes no attempt to determine segmentation boundaries; the algorithm can be viewed as a classification scheme which segments the data into collections of points which are ``from&#039;&#039; the same surface.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">Reducing synchronization constraints in parallel simulated annealing
algorithms can improve performance.  However, this introduces error in
the global cost function.  Previous work in parallel simulated
annealing suggests that if the amount of error in the cost function is
controlled, good quality results can still be obtained.  In this
paper, we present a model of error in asynchronous parallel simulated
annealing algorithms to partition graphs and use it to predict the
behavior of three different synchronization strategies.  These three
approaches were implemented on a 20-processor Encore, a shared memory,
MIMD multiprocessor, and tested on a variety of graphs.

As predicted, the strategy which allows controlled error yields
solutions comparable to those of the serial algorithm with greatly
improved running time.  Speedups from 5 to 11 (depending on the
density of the graphs) using 16 processors were obtained.  In
contrast, the more synchronized version exhibited unacceptably high
running times, whereas the version characterized by uncontrolled error
yielded significantly poorer results.  This confirms behavior seen in
parallel simulated annealing algorithms to perform placement in VLSI
circuit layout systems.</td>

represents learned concepts as a binary polythetic decision tree.  Polythetic
trees differ from monothetic decision trees in that a logical combination
of multiple (versus a single) attribute values may label each tree
arc.  Statistical evaluations are used to recursively partition the concept
space in two and expand the tree.  As with standard decision trees,
leaves denote classifications.  Classes are predicted for unseen instances 
by traversing appropriate branches in the tree to the leaves.  Empirical
results demonstrated that BCT is generally more accurate or comparable to 
two earlier systems.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">In this paper we consider the communication complexity of maintaining
the replicas of a logical data-item, in a database distributed over a
computer network.  We propose a new method, called the minimum
spanning tree write, by which a processor in the network should
multicast a write of a logical data-item, to all the processors that
store replicas of the item. Then we show that the minimum spanning
tree write is optimal from the communication cost point of view.  We
also demonstrate that the method by which a write is multicast to all
the replicas of a data-item, affects the optimal replication scheme of
the item, i.e., at which processors in the network the replicas should
be located.  Therefore, next we consider the problem of determining an
optimal replication scheme for a data item, assuming that each
processor employs the minimum spanning tree write at run-time.  The
problem for general networks is shown NP-Complete, but we provide
efficient algorithms to obtain an optimal allocation scheme for three
common types of network topologies.  They are completely-connected,
tree, and ring networks.  For these topologies, efficient algorithms
are also provided for the case in which reliability considerations
dictate a minimum number of replicas.</td>

datalog rule programs, mainly by processors that are interconnected by
a communication network.  We introduce a paradigm, called
data-reduction, for the parallel evaluation of a general datalog
program. Several parallelization strategies discussed previously in
[CW, GST, W, WS] are special cases of this paradigm.  The paradigm
parallelizes the evaluation by partitioning among the processors the
instantiations of the rules.  After presenting the paradigm, we
discuss the following issues, that we see fundamental for
parallelization strategies derived from the paradigm: properties of
the strategies that enable a reduction in the communication overhead,
decomposability, load balancing, and application to programs with
negation.  We prove that decomposability, a concept introduced
previously in [WS, CW], is undecidable.</td>

of distributed file systems, with a particular emphasis on the problem
of high availability.  Several of the techniques involved in building
such a system are discussed individually: naming, replication,
multiple versions, caching, stashing, and logging.  These techniques
range from extensions of ideas used in centralized file systems,
through new notions already in use, to radical ideas that have not yet
been implemented.  A number of working and proposed systems are
described in conjunction with the analysis of each technique.  The
paper concludes that a low degree of replication, a liberal use of
client and server caching, and optimistic behavior in the face of
network partition are all necessary to ensure high availability.</td>

                    <td class="col-md-2">We consider the problem of atomic commitment of a transaction
in a distributed database.  This is a variant of the famous gossiping
problem (see [HHL] for a survey).  Given a set of communication costs
between pairs of participant sites, we establish that the necessary
communication cost for any atomic commitment algorithm is twice the
cost of a certain minimum spanning tree.  We also establish the
necessary communication time for any atomic commitment algorithm,
given a set of communication delays between pairs of participant
sites, and the time at which each participant completes its
subtransaction.  Then we determine that both lower bounds are also
upper bounds in the following sense.  There is an efficient (i.e.
polynomial-time) algorithm that, in the absence of failures, has a
minimum communication cost.  There is another efficient algorithm
that, in the absence of failures, has a minimum communication time.
However, unless P=NP, there is no efficient algorithm which has a
minimum communication complexity, namely, for which the product of
communication cost and communication time is minimum.  Then we present
a simple, linear time, distributed algorithm, called TREE-COMMIT,
whose communication complexity is not worse than $p$ times the minimum
complexity, where $p$ is the number of participants.  Finally, we
demonstrate that TREE-COMMIT is superior to the existing variations of
the two-phase commit protocol.</td>

autocorrelation moments.  This technique is applied to natural images
of planar textured surfaces and gives significantly improved results
when applied to anisotropic textures which under the assumption of
isotropy mimic the effects of projective foreshortening.  The

placement and optical settings of vision sensors in order to meet
certain generic task requirements common to most industrial machine
vision applications. From the planned viewpoints, features of interest
on an object will satisfy particular constraints in the image. In this
work, the vision sensor is a CCD camera equipped with a programmable
lens (i.e. zoom lens) and the image constraints considered are:
visibility, resolution and field of view. The proposed approach uses a
geometric model of the object as well as a model of the sensor, in
order to reason about the task and the environment. The sensor
planning system then computes the regions in space as well as the
optical settings that satisfy each of the constraints separately.
These results are finally combined to generate acceptable viewing
locations and optical settings satisfying all constraints
simultaneously.  Camera planning experiments are described in which a
robot-arm positions the camera at a computed location and the planned
optical settings are set automatically. The corresponding scenes from
the candidate viewpoints are shown demonstrating that the constraints
are indeed satisfied. Other constraints, such as depth of focus, as
well as other vision sensors can also be considered resulting in a
fully integrated sensor planning system.</td>

approach for providing intelligent assistance to developers working on
a large-scale  software project.  RBDEs  model the development process
in terms of rules,  and then enact this  model by automatically firing
rules at  the  appropriate  time.  The RBDE  approach has been used to
develop single-user environments, but support  for multiple developers
cooperating on the same project is still not  available because of the
lack  of mechanisms  that can synchronize    the  efforts of  multiple
developers, who concurrently  select commands, causing  the  firing of
multiple rules  (either directly  or  via chaining)  that concurrently
access shared data.  Conflicts  between different rules and concurrent
access  to shared data may cause  the  violation of consistency in the
project  database,  and  thus    necessitate the  synchronization   of
concurrent  activities.   The conjecture of  this  proposal is that an
RBDE can provide the  required synchronization  if it is provided with
knowledge about what it means for the data of a specific project to be
in  a consistent state,  and about the semantics  of   operations that
developers perform on the data.  The research that this paper proposes
will formulate  a framework for  specifying consistency of data  in an
RBDE,  and formulate  a mechanism  for  synchronizing the  actions  of
concurrent rules fired on behalf of multiple developers cooperating on
a common or different tasks.</td>

is commonly recovered from time-varying imagery in the form of a
two-dimensional image-flow field.  This thesis is about computation of
image-flow.

A new framework is proposed that classifies the image-flow information
available in time-varying imagery into two categories - conservation
information and neighborhood information.  Each type of information is
recovered in the form of an estimate accompanied by a
covariance-matrix.  Image-flow is then computed by fusing the two
estimates using estimation-theoretic techniques. This framework is
shown to allow estimation of certain types of discontinuous
flow-fields without any a-priori knowledge about the location of
discontinuities.  An algorithm based on this framework is described.
Results of applying this algorithm to a variety of image-sequences are
also discussed.

The new framework is shown to be applicable identically to each one of
the three major approaches for recovering conservation information,
i.e., gradient-based approach, correlation-based approach and
spatiotemporal energy-based approach. The formulation of neighborhood
information used in this framework is also shown to reduce to some of
the existing smoothing-based formulations under various simplifying
assumptions. In essence, the framework described in this thesis
unifies various existing approaches for image-flow computation. Such
unification is shown to be useful in analyzing various existing
frameworks as well as in generating new frameworks.

The new framework is also shown to serve as a platform to integrate
the three approaches mentioned above. It is observed that the
measurements obtained by the three approaches have different
error-characteristics. This situation is regarded analogous to the
multi-sensor fusion problem, where the algorithms based on the three
approaches behave as multiple sensors measuring image-flow.  An
integrated framework is described that applies the principles of
statistical estimation theory to fuse the measurements obtained from
different approaches. The resulting estimate of image-flow has the
minimum expected-error. Some algorithms based on this framework are
described. Several proposals for extension of this thesis are also
included.</td>

                <p>President Bollinger announced that Columbia University along with many other academic institutions (sixteen, including all Ivy League universities) filed an <a href="http://news.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/Darweesh%20university%20amicus%20brief%202%2013%2017%20FINAL.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://news.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/Darweesh%2520university%2520amicus%2520brief%25202%252013%252017%2520FINAL.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1487940688684000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDp02Dc-_sOPGOVcC_VPO9luEMBQ">amicus brief</a> in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York challenging the Executive Order regarding immigrants from seven designated countries and refugees. Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents &#8211; all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.</p>
<p>I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mary C. Boyce<br />
Dean of Engineering<br />
Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor</p>
