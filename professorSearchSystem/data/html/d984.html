			My research group works on making it easier to write computer programs, mostly using program synthesis, a technique for computer-aided construction of software. Our research agenda is to develop programming languages and tools in which the human is allowed to give incomplete instructions; from these, a complete program is obtained in a dialogue with a “programmer assistant.”</p>

			<h3>Foundations of program synthesis</h3>
			<p>
			With collaborators, my group developed the ideas of algorithmic synthesis using  sketches (partial programs) and constraint solving.  We have later generalized the ideas to so-called solver-aided languages, which simplify programming by delegating coding tasks to a constraint solver.  We also work on mining specifications and synthesis-aided programmer tools.

				Rosette and solver-aided domain-specific languages.</a>				
			  	Our work on algorithmic synthesis (sketching, angelic programming) has evolved into extending small languages with constructs that delegate programmer work to a constraint solver.  Rosetter is a host language for SDSL construction, developed by Emina Torlak.

			<h3 class="theme">Large-scale synthesis and rethinking compilers</h3>
			<p>
				To scale synthesis to system software, we are developing abstract and modular synthesis algorithms.  To facilitate rapid development of advanced compilers, we are exploring the idea of a synthesis-aided compiler.

			  	We used abstract synthesis to generate a parallel layout engine for the web browser and <a target="_blank" href="http://superconductor.github.io/superconductor/">data visualization</a>.  Currently, we are working on synthesis of an efficient incremental layout algorithm that is also statically parallelizable.  A collaboration with Mozilla.
