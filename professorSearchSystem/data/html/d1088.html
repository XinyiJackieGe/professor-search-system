<b>"A Level-Encoded Transition Signaling Protocol for High-Throughput

A new delay-insensitive data encoding scheme for global communication,
level-encoded transition signaling (LETS), is introduced.
LETS is a generalization of level-encoded dual rail (LEDR),
an earlier non-return-to-zero encoding scheme where one of two wires changes
value per data bit per transaction.
In LETS, only one of $N=2^n$ (1-of-$N$) wire changes value per n data bits per
transaction. Compared to most common return-to-zero encoding schemes, 
LETS has potential
power and throughput advantages, since fewer rails switch and no
return-to-zero phase is required.
Compared to existing non-return-to-zero schemes (i.e., LEDR),
higher-dimension LETS codes have a potential power advantage,
with significantly reduced switching activity per data bit.

Two alternative 1-of-4 LETS codes are proposed,
and efficient hardware for completion detection
and conversion to return-to-zero protocols is introduced.
Finally, a general theoretical framework is presented which
characterizes the properties of arbitrary 1-of-$N$ LETS codes,
as well as a simple procedure to generate such codes.

The time separation of events (TSE) problem is that of finding the
maximum and minimum separation between the times of occurrence of two events
in a concurrent system.
It has applications in the performance analysis,
optimization and verification of concurrent digital systems.
This paper introduces an efficient polynomial-time algorithm to give 
exact bounds on TSE's 
for choice-free concurrent systems, whose operational semantics obey
the max-causality rule.
A choice-free concurrent system is modeled as a strongly-connected
marked graph, where delays on operations
are modeled as bounded intervals with unspecified distributions.
While previous approaches handle acyclic systems only, or else require
graph unfolding until a steady-state behavior is reached, the proposed
approach directly identifies and evaluates the asymptotic
steady-state behavior of a cyclic system via a graph-theoretical approach.
As a result, the method has significantly lower computational complexity
than  previously-proposed solutions.
A prototype CAD tool has been developed 
to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of our method.
A set of experiments have been performed on the tool as well as two
existing tools, with noticeable improvement on runtime and accuracy for
several examples.

          This paper presents an efficient method for the performance analysis
          and optimization of asynchronous systems.
          An asynchronous system is modeled as a marked graph with
          probabilistic delay distributions.
          We show that these systems exhibit inherent periodic behaviors. 
          Based on this property, we derive
          an algorithm to construct the state space of the system through
          composition and capture the time evolution of the states into 
          a periodic Markov chain.
          The system is solved for important performance metrics such as
          the distribution of input arrival time at a component, 
          which is useful for subsequent system optimization,
          as well as relative component utilization, system latency and
          throughput. 
          We also present a tool to demonstrate the feasibility of this method.
          Initial experimental results are promising, showing over three 
          orders of magnitude improvement in 
          runtime and nearly two orders of magnitude decrease in the size of the
          state space over previously published results.
          While the focus of this paper is on asynchronous digital systems,
          our technique can be applied to other concurrent systems that exhibit
          global asynchronous behavior, such as GALS and embedded systems.

          This paper presents a unifying framework for the modeling of 
          asynchronous pipeline circuits.
          A pipeline protocol is captured in a graph-based model which
          defines the partial ordering of both its control and data events.
          The relationship between an entire space of different protocols is 
          then captured in a semi-lattice,
          which has well-defined top and bottom elements, corresponding to 
          the most concurrent and least concurrent protocol variants, 
          respectively.  This framework also provides a set of 
          correct-by-construction transformation 
          rules which allows for the systematic exploration of the 
          entire design space by their successive application. 
          To the best of our knowledge, this is the first formal framework
          for asynchronous pipelines which can capture protocols from a variety           of logic style families, including both dynamic and static. It is also          the first to provide a formal foundation for the design-space 
          exploration of asynchronous pipelines.

This paper shows that self-timed meshes can achieve linear speed-up.
The per-processor performance of a mesh is the average number of operations
per processor per unit time.
For synchronous processors, it has been shown that the per-processor
performance of a mesh goes to zero as the size of the mesh goes to infinity.
This paper shows that for self-timed meshes, the per-processor performance
can be bounded below by a positive constant.
Thus, self-timed meshes are asymptotically faster than synchronous ones.
Furthermore, simulation and analytic results are used to show that analysis
based solely on average case times can be optimistic and lead to poor design
decisions.
