            <p>Dr. Lane is an accomplished researcher, 
			educator and entrepreneur with over 25 years of experience 
			designing, developing and commercializing advanced 3D graphics and 
			animation technology for use in computer games, virtual reality, and 
			distributed simulation and training applications. Dr. Lane&#8217;s 
			responsibilities have ranged from basic technology development to 
			computer hardware and software design, project management and 
			business development. <span>&nbsp;</span>He is currently an Professor of Practice in the Computer &amp; Info Science Dept. and<span>&nbsp;</span>also 
			President of <span class="auto-style5">
			<a href="http://www.sovoz.com">soVoz, Inc</a></span>., a 
			company developing advanced virtual reality user interfaces for 
			immersive training and gaming applications.&nbsp; <span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3 class="auto-style3"><strong>Research Interests</strong></h3>

            <p>Dr. Lane has an active research agenda with interests in the 
			areas of physically-based character animation, embodied intelligent 
			agents and alternative user interfaces (including virtual reality 
			and augmented reality). Specifically, the 
			intersection of where the fields of control theory, artificial 
			intelligence, robotics and computer animation meet. </p>

            <h3><strong>Teaching</strong></h3>
            <p><span>Dr. Lane is currently the Director of the 
			<a href="http://www.cg.cis.upenn.edu/cggt_program.html">Computer Graphics 
			and Game Technology (CGGT) Masters Program</a>.&nbsp; Drawing on his 
			background and experience in the computer gaming industry, Dr. Lane 
			teaches courses on Computer Animation (CIS462/562), Advanced Topics 
			in Computer Graphics and Animation (CIS660) and Game Design and 
			Development (CIS564).&nbsp; Dr. Lane also supervises the Game Design 
			Practicum (CIS568) which is the capstone project course required to be completed 
			by all CGGT students.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p><span><a href="CIS462-562_Syllabus.html">CIS462/562: Computer Animation</a> - provides students with a 
			solid technical foundation for developing, animating and controlling 
			articulated systems used in interactive computer games, virtual 
			reality simulations and high-end animation applications.&nbsp; The course 
			balances theory with practice by &#8220;looking under the hood&#8221; of a 
			number of popular commercial animation packages and exams the 
			technologies and techniques used from both a computer science and 
			engineering perspective.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p><span><a href="CIS660_Syllabus.html">CIS660: Advanced Topics in Computer Graphics and Animation</a> 
			- exposes students to the current state-of-the-art of research in 
			the fields of computer graphics and animation in a seminar-like 
			setting.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p><span><a href="CIS564_Syllabus.html">CIS564: Computer Game Design and Development</a> - provides 
			students with a solid theoretical understanding of the core creative 
			principles, concepts, and game play structures and schemas 
			underlying most game designs.&nbsp; The course also examines game 
			development from an engineering point of view, including: game play 
			mechanics, game engine software and hardware architectures, user 
			interfaces, design documents, play testing and production methods.&nbsp;
			</span></p>
				<p><a href="CIS568_Syllabus.html">CIS568: Game Design Practicum</a> 
				- provides students with an opportunity to create a orginal game 
				prototype by applying what they have learned about graphics, 
				animation and game design in CIS560, CIS562 and CIS564.</p>
