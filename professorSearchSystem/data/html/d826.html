Nelson Morgan is a humble researcher and the former director of the International Computer
Science Institute (ICSI), an independent not-for profit research
laboratory that is closely affiliated with UC Berkeley. In addition to
these roles he led the
<a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/Speech/index.html">Speech
Group</a>
at ICSI from
1988 until 2012. He is also is a Professor-in-residence (emeritus)
in the 
<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/">
EECS Department</a> at the
<a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">
University of California at Berkeley</a>, where he received his Ph.D.
as an NSF Fellow in 1980.
He has been working on problems
in signal processing and pattern recognition since 1974, with a primary
emphasis on speech processing. He may have been the first to use neural
networks for speech classification in a commercial application, and
to incorporate time-frequency distributions for event-related
potentials (brain waves). He is a former Editor-in-chief of Speech
Communication, and has been a member of the IEEE Speech Technical Committee and the IEEE Neural Networks Committee. He is also
a Fellow of the IEEE and of the International Speech Communication
Association (ISCA). In 1997 he received the Signal Processing Magazine best
paper award (together with co-author Herve Bourlard).
He was the Principal Investigator
for the multi-site coalition funded by the DARPA EARS 
<a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/Speech/EARS/na.html">
Novel
Approaches</a> project, which was the 2002-5 US government program
focusing on long term progress in speech recognition.
<p>
Professor Morgan has been the US representative on a number of
collaborations with European researchers, including several European
Union projects. As Director (from 1999-2012, and from 2013-2014), he was responsible
for ICSI's visitor programs with other countries, particularly
Finland, Brazil, Germany, and Switzerland. He is also on a number of
Boards, in addition to ICSI's: 
the Board of Trustees of the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago;
the Speech Communication Editorial Board; and 
Sensory, Inc.'s Advisory Board.
He was the General Chair of Interspeech 2016, which was held in San Francisco; this is the premier international conference for speech engineering and science.
<p>
Professor Morgan has over 200
<a href="pubs.html">
publications</a>
including three technical books; these include
a text (written jointly with Ben Gold) on speech and
audio signal processing, with a 2011 second edition that was revised in
collaboration with Dan Ellis
of Columbia University. He holds a
number of patents in speech processing methods, including one that has
been used in millions of CDMA cell phones (jointly developed with Hynek
Hermansky). His 
research interests have included the redesign from first principles of the
primary signal processing used in speech recognition systems, and the use
of neural networks for the design of these new features. Most recently he has also been working on a project aimed at finding technological means to reduce the influence of money on politics. He has written a book on the topic called "We Can Fix It". This effort led to a startup that he heads (see uprise.org) that directly works in this area.
