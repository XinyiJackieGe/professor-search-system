				I am a research assistant professor in the Computer and Information Science at Penn.  My team seeks to use tools from math and computer science to address large-scale societal goals.  Two goals that are at the forefront of our current work are 1) privacy and security in digital environments, 2) facilitating transparency and trust.

				To accomplish these goals, my team conducts primary research in cryptography and coding theory, with an emphasis on translating mathematically sound, rigorous algorithmic developments into practical tools for solving real-world problems.  We also partner with external stakeholders to identify societal problems, and solutions enabled by computer science.

				I have worked extensively designing and implementing protocols for secure computation, that effectively allow a collection of stakeholders to collaborate securely, without sharing sensitive data, and without the need for a centralized trusted authority.

				Blockchain technology represents another approach for using cryptography to allow mutually distrustful entities to interact without the need for a centralized trusted authority, and my research group now has several projects in this space, analyzing the technical underpinnings of existing systems, and developing new solutions built on rigorous, mathematical design principles.

				My research has been funded by the NSF, DARPA, IARPA, the Office of Naval Research, the Army Research Lab, the National Institute of Health, and the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.
