				<title>Richard Fujimoto is a Regents’ Professor in the School of Computational Science and Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He received the Ph.D. and M.S. degrees from the University of California-Berkeley in 1983 and 1980 in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering and B.S. degrees from the University of Illinois-Urbana in 1977 and 1978 in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. Fujimoto’s research is concerned with the execution of discrete-event simulation programs on parallel and distributed computing platforms. This research has included work on platforms ranging from mobile distributed computing systems to supercomputers. His work spans several application areas including transportation systems, telecommunication networks, multiprocessor and defense systems. He led the working group that was responsible for defining the time management services of the High Level Architecture (IEEE Standard 1516). He received the ACM SIGSIM Distinguished Contributions in Simulation Award, the I/ITSEC Fellow Award, and numerous best paper awards for his publications. He is a fellow of the ACM and IEEE.Fujimoto was the founding chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) at Georgia Tech and served in this role from 2005 to 2014. During this period he grew the school to include 13 tenure track faculty and annual research expenditures of $8.8 Million. He created CSE education programs at Georgia Tech – interdisciplinary M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs in CSE, the CSE “thread” of Georgia Tech’s undergraduate computer science program, two undergraduate minor programs, and the CRUISE (Computing Research Undergraduate Intern Summer Experience) program including outreach to women and minority students. He created the College of Computing’s first on-line degree program with the on-line MS program in CSE and co-led the development of a professional masters program in Analytics. | Richard Fujimoto</title>
