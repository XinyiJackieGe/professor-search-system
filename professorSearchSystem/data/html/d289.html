Karl Lieberherr, Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston
<p>
 A Short History: I started my research career in computer science as a
 theoretical computer scientist, focusing on  the theory of 
<A href="
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/p-optimal/README.html
">
local versus global satisfaction for the generalized maxiumum satisfiability problem (MAX-CSP),
</a>
 still an active area of research. 
I also invented, 
<A href="
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/clause-learning/non-chrono-backtrack.html
">
independently and simultaneously on the other side of the Atlantic,
</a>
an early form of
<A href="
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/clause-learning/summary.html
">
non-chronological backtracking based on learned clauses
</a>
(superresolution) which has become a key feature of most 
state-of-the-art 
<A href="
http://www.satlive.org/
">
SAT 
</a>
and CSP solvers.
</p>
Over the last few years, the work on P-optimal algorithms has influenced the development 
of a computational model for scientific communities. The model
is realized as
an exciting, fun but serious game, called the 
<A href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/evergreen/specker/scg-home.html">
Scientific Community Game
(SCG)</a> (also called the Specker Challenge Game)
which is used
as a teaching innovation
in CS courses.
Besides teaching, SCG has applications to crowdsourcing of computational problem
solving.
<P>
SCG has been analyzed in Ahmed Abdelmeged's dissertation.
SCG is essentially a tournament of semantic games, guaranteeing that a
perfect player must rank at the top.
The players who are good at chosing the correct side (verifier or falsifier)
and defending their side in a semantic game, win the tournament.

<p>
 Next I applied my theoretical knowledge to another practical problem: the design
 and implementation of 
<A href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/zeus/zeus.html">
the Hardware Description Language Zeus,</a>
 a predecessor of VHDL.

</p>

<p>
 In the mid 1980s, I switched to 
 Object-Oriented and 
 <A href="
 http://aosd.net/
  ">Aspect-Oriented Software Development</a>
 and focused on issues of software design and modularity.
 I founded the 
 <A href="
 http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/team-members.html
  ">Demeter research team,</a>
 which
 studied the then-novel idea of 
 <A href="
 http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeter/biblio/dem-book.html
  ">Adaptive Programming</a>, also known as
  structure-shy programming
 and produced the
 <A href="
  http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/LoD.html
  ">Law of Demeter</a> ("talk only to your friends": an explicit form of coupling control)
and several systems for separating concerns in an
 object-oriented programming context: 
 <A href="
 http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/inside-impl.html
 ">
 Demeter/Flavors, Demeter/C++, DemeterJ, DJ, XAspects.
 </a>
 The new tool,
  <a href= "http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeter/DemeterF">
 DemeterF 
 </a>, adds the power of fine-grained type checking to control the
 evolution of functional, adaptive programs that 
 can be easily re-targeted to different architectures,
 e.g. multi-core architectures.
<p>
My current area of research is 
 <A href="
https://sites.google.com/view/neural-mcts/home
    ">Neural MCTS</a> inspired by the success of AlphaZero.

<!  side-choosing games, again with the acronym SCG. SCGs are a basic concept for several areas, such as general game playing in AI, algorithmic problem solving and peer grading.

<! My current area of research is Human Computation, specifically the
<A href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/evergreen/specker/scg-home.html">
<! Scientific Community Game
(SCG)</a> 
<! which will produce a knowledge base which could
be called the "Wikipedia for Formal Scientific Knowledge"./>
<!In 2006 I added Systems Biology to my areas of interest. I spent my 2006 sabbatical
at Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research and discovered that 
SAT and CSP solvers play an important role in biological applications.
/>
<! We focus on engineering modular and fast CSP solvers (using P-optimality and non-chronological
backtracking) and
applying them to Systems Biology problems. />
