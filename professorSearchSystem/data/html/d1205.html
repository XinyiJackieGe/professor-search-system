Dr. Shang-Hua Teng has twice won the prestigious
  G&#246del Prize in theoretical computer science,
  first in 2008, for developing the theory of <i> smoothed analysis</i>,
  and then in 2015, for designing the 
  groundbreaking  nearly-linear time <i> Laplacian solver </i> for
  network systems.
Both are joint work with Dan Spielman of Yale ---
   his long-time collaborator.
Smoothed analysis is fundamental for
  modeling and analyzing practical algorithms,
  and the <i> Laplacian paradigm </i>
  has since led to several
  breakthroughs in network analysis, matrix computation, and optimization.
Citing him as, ``one of the most original theoretical computer
  scientists in the world'', the Simons Foundation
  named Teng  a 2014 Simons Investigator, for
  pursuing long-term curiosity-driven fundamental research.
He and his collaborators also received
  the best paper award at <i> ACM Symposium on
  Theory of Computing </i> (STOC) for what's considered to be the
  ``first improvement in 10 years'' of a fundamental optimization problem
  --- the computation of <i> maximum flows and minimum cuts </i>
   in a  network.
In addition, he is known for his joint work with Xi Chen and Xiaotie
  Deng that characterized the complexity for computing an approximate Nash
  equilibrium in game theory, and his joint papers on market equilibria
  in computational economics.
He and his collaborators also
 pioneered the development of well-shaped Dalaunay
  meshing algorithms for arbitrary three-dimensional geometric domains,
  which  settled
  a long-term open problem in numerical simulation, also
  a fundamental problem in computer graphics.
Software based on this development was used at
  the University of Illinois for the simulation of advanced rockets.
Teng is also
  interested in mathematical board games.
With his former Ph.D. student Kyle Burke, he designed and
  analyzed a game called <i> Atropos </i>,
  which is played on the Sperner's triangle and based on the beautiful,
  celebrated Sperner's Lemma.
In 2000 at UIUC, Teng was named on the <i> List of Teachers Ranked as
  Excellent by Their Students </i> for his class,
   ``Network Security and Cryptography''.
He has worked and consulted for Microsoft Research, Akamai, IBM
  Almaden Research Center, Intel Corporation, Xerox PARC,
  and NASA Ames Research Center, for which he received
  fifteen <i> patents </i> for his work on
 compiler optimization, Internet technology, and social network.

<!--    fixed points and market equilibria is not polynomial unless PPAD is -->
<!--       in RP. -->
<!--       (With Xi Chen and Xiaotie Deng; Li-Sha Huang; and Paul Valiant). -->
 
 
<!-- <p> -->
<!--  <b> Nearly-Linear Time Graph Algorithms:</b> -->
<!--     Developed the first nearly linear-time algorithm for spectral -->
<!--     partitioning, graph sparsification, and local clustering. (With -->
<!--       Dan Spielman). -->
<!--     Proved that every weighted connected graph has a subgraph spanning -->
<!--     tree of average stretch O(log<sup>2</sup> n loglog n) and -->
<!--     developed a nearly linear-time algorithm for construting the -->
<!--     low-stretch spanning tree. (With Michael Elkin, Yuval Emek, and Dan Spielman) -->
   
   
 
      
<!-- <p> -->
<!--  <b> Combinatorial Scientific Computing:</b> Developed the first -->
<!--       nearly linear-time algorithm for preconditioning and -->
<!--       solving symmetric diagonally-dominant linear systems. -->
<!-- Our work solved an open question posted by Pravin Vaidya in 1990. (With Dan Spielman). -->
<!--  <p> -->
 
<!--    <b> Mesh Generation and Computational Geometry:</b> -->
<!--     Solved a major open question in three dimensional mesh generation by -->
<!--      developing the first provably good technique to remove slivers and to generate -->
<!--       well-shaped Delaunay meshes in three dimensions. (With Siu-Wing Chen, Tamal Dey,  -->
<!--        Herbert Edelsbrunner, and Mike Facello; and Xiang-Yang Li). -->
<!--         Developed the sphere-packing based Delaunay and Voronoi meshing and coarsening -->
<!-- 	  algorithm -->
<!-- 	   in two and three dimensions (with Gary Miller, Dafna Talmor, and Noel Walkington). -->
  
 
<!--  <p> -->
<!-- <b> Spectral Graph Theory and Graph Partitioning: </b> -->
<!-- Proved a significant result in spectral graph theory: From the second eigenvector -->
<!-- of a planar graph, we can compute, in linear time, a partition whose the quality is as -->
<!-- good as that can be achieved by the classic Lipton-Tarjan's planar separator algorithm. -->
<!-- Our result also shows that the Fiedler value of a bounded-degree planar  -->
<!-- graph of n vertices in O(1/n). (With Dan Spielman). -->
 
<!--  <p> -->
<!-- <b> Geometric Graph Partitioning and N-Body Simulation:</b> Extended the separator theorem of Lipton-Tarjan -->
<!-- to high dimensions by proving an optimal separator theorem for well-shaped meshes and  -->
<!-- nearest neighborhood graphs in any fixed dimensions (with Gary Miller, William -->
<!-- Thurston, and Steve Vavasis). -->
<!-- Developed the first optimal  -->
<!-- load balancing scheme for non-uniform N-body simulation in three dimensions. -->
 
<!-- <p> -->
<!-- <b> Computational Geometry: Meshing and Robust Statistics: </b> Developed the first randomized O(log n)  -->
<!-- time, n-processor algorithm for computing the k-nearest neighborhood graphs -->
<!-- in any fixed dimensions (with Alan Frieze and Gary Miller), first  -->
<!-- optimal parallel algorithm for generating quadtrees and nearest neighborhood -->
<!-- graphs (with Marshall Bern and David Eppstein), and first provably good parallel -->
<!-- Delaunay meshing algorithm (with Dan Spielman and Alper Ungor). -->
<!-- Proved the Rousseeuw-Hubert conjecture on regression depth, -->
<!--   providing an important theorem for Robust Statistics -->
<!--   and Inference (Nina Amenta, Marshall Bern, and David Eppstein). -->
