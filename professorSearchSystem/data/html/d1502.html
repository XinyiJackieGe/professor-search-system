I am also affiliated with the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. I am a member of the 			<a href="https://precise.seas.upenn.edu/" class="inline" target="_blank">PRECISE Center</a>.			My research broadly concerns the design, analysis, and security of <b>Medical Cyber-Physical Systems</b> (MCPS) and the <b>Internet of Medical Things</b> (IoMT). Specifically, I develop foundations that address challenges arising from the intersection of <b>data science</b>, <b>embedded systems</b>, <b>cyber-security</b> and <b>healthcare</b>.  I am involved in several 			<a href="research.html" class="inline">medical technology projects</a> 			and lead the 			<a href="https://rtg.cis.upenn.edu/meddevclub" class="inline" target="_blank">Medical Device Club</a> at Penn.			-->			<!--			control theory, signal processing, data science			-->			<!--			My research develops foundations for the safe and secure control of cyber-physical systems (CPS) -- and applies them to healthcare.	CPS represent a new era of safety-critical embedded systems that feature tight coupling between communication and computation used to control complex, uncertain, and potentially adverse physical plants. In critical infrastructures (e.g., healthcare, energy, transportation, manufacturing) existing robust engineering paradigms do not address the combination of challenges imposed by closed-loop CPS: strict safety and performance requirements, constrained sensing and actuation capabilities, unreliable communication and computation platforms, and potentially malicious feedback information. In medical CPS, these challenges also include unidentifiable non-linear time-varying physiological processes that result in significant model uncertainty -- an unfavorable environment for safe and secure closed-loop control. <br> &nbsp <br>			My research focuses on control systems engineering for CPS, encompassing control system design, analysis, and implementation.			The long-term goal enables high-assurance control of CPS through new algorithm designs, which consider implementation 			constraints, such that the resulting real-world system facilitates analysis. Achieving this goal -- especially in 			healthcare -- requires control system designs that conform to the platform resources while also providing predictable 			performance in spite of complex cyber-physical interactions. Quantifying the trade-offs between performance, safety, 			reliability, and security in the control designs requires new analysis tools and techniques. Validating control system 			design assumptions requires real-world implementations that provide evidentiary support and enable identifying unforeseen 			challenges and future research. <br>			-->					</div>		<hr max-width="1000px"></hr>		<div align="left" class="paragraph">Recent News<br> </div>		<div align="left" class="text"> 			<ul>					<li> Appointed an Associate Editor of <a href="https://health.acm.org/" class="inline" target="_blank">ACM Transactions of Computing for Healthcare (ACM HEALTH)</a>								<li> We received the <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~weimerj/pdf/2019-memocode.pdf" class="inline" target="_blank">Best Paper Award</a> at MEMOCODE'19.</li>					<li><a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9936691&icde=47034448&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=2&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball="  class="inline" target="_blank">Opioid Monitoring System</a> project funded by NIH NIBIB as an R01.</li>				<li><a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9936691&icde=47034445&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=2&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball="  class="inline" target="_blank">AutoWean</a> project funded by NIH NIBIB as an R01</li>				<li><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1915398&HistoricalAwards=false" class="inline" target="_blank">Smart Alarms 2.0</a> project funded by NSF Smart and Connected Health (SCH) program</li>				<li><a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9908791&icde=47046665&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=3&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=" class="inline" target="_blank">Sense Support</a> project funded as an NIH STTR (with Promptworks and Drexel)</li>				<li>Program Committee Co-Chair for <a href="http://iccps.acm.org/2020/" class="inline" target="_blank">ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS) 2020</a></li>				<li>CHASE Conference Organizing Committee: Workshop Chair for <a href="https://conferences.computer.org/chase2019/" class="inline" target="_blank">IEEE/ACM Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems, and Engineering Technologies (CHASE) 2019</a></li>				<li>MCPS Research Featured in <a href="https://medium.com/penn-engineering/inventing-the-interconnected-future-90f68ab8698a" class="inline" target="_blank">Penn Engineering Magazine</a></li>				<!--				<li>Co-Chair of the <a href="https://rtg.cis.upenn.edu/mcps-workshop-2018/" class="inline" target="_blank">Medical CPS Workshop</a> at CPS week 2018				<li>Best paper award at CPSNA 2016</li>				<li>1st place finish in the F1/10 competition at ES week 2016</li>				<li>Best paper finalist award at ICCPS 2015</li>				<li>Best paper award at ICCPS 2014</li>				-->			</ul>		</div>		<hr max-width="1000px"></hr>	</div></body><script>  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)  })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');  ga('create', 'UA-70606121-1', 'auto');  ga('send', 'pageview');</script>
