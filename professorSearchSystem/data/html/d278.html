  <h2>Message for Prospective PhD Students:</h2>
    I am actively looking for PhD students who enjoy applying well-founded program analysis techniques to relevant problems that 
    occur in real-world software. Prospective students should share my interest in implementing such techniques in practical tools, conducting
    thorough experimental evaluations, publishing results in top conferences in the areas of Programming Languages and Software Engineering,
    and making significant contributions to the open-source community. 
    <br>
    For more information about my research, please take a look at my <a href="research.html">research</a> page for some examples of current projects, 
    or read some of my recent <a href="pubs.html">publications</a>.  Please send me an e-mail if you would like to talk about how our
    research interests might align.
