<h3> Biography</h3>
<p> <b> Non-technical version:</b> 
<p> Thad Starner is a wearable computing pioneer. In 1990, Starner coined
the term "augmented reality" to describe the types of interfaces he
envisioned for the future, and he has been using a head worn display
as part of his daily life since 1993. Thad is a Professor in the
School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology
and a Technical Lead on Google's Glass, which was named a "50 Most
Influential Gadget of All Time" by Time Magazine. Thad has produced
over 500 papers and presentations, and he is an inventor on over 80
awarded United States utility patents.  Starner has presented his work
at the World Economic Forum, UNESCO, the National Academy of Sciences,
and Google I/O.  Thad's research has been covered by CBS's 60 Minutes
and 48 Hours; ABC's Nightline; PBS's News Hour; NPR's RadioLab,
Invisibilia, KQED Forum, and Diane Reim Show; Fox News; CNN Headline News;
the BBC; Scientific American; National Geographic; The New York Times;
New Scientist; and The Wall Street Journal.  He is always looking for
a good game of table tennis.



<p> <b> Technical version:</b> 
<p> Thad Starner is a wearable computing pioneer, having worn a computer
with a head-up display in his daily life since 1993. Dr. Starner is a
Professor of Computing at Georgia Tech and a Technical Lead on Google
Glass.  Besides Glass, Thad's projects include a wireless glove that
teaches how to play piano melodies without active attention by the
wearer; a glove that helps stroke patients recover tone, sensation,
and dexterity in their hands; a game for deaf children using computer
vision-based sign language recognition that helps them acquire
language skills; underwater wearable computers for two-way
communication experiments with wild dolphins; wearable computers for
working dogs to facilitate communication with their handlers; brain
computer interfaces that recover phrase-level sign language from the
motor cortex; and systems for recognizing English speech without
vocalization. Dr. Starner is a founder of the annual ACM International
Symposium on Wearable Computers, now in its 22nd year. Thad has
produced over 500 papers and presentations with over 300 co-authors
and has over 80 issued United States utility patents. He was elected
to the CHI Academy in 2017 and was a finalist for the Lemelson-MIT
Prize for inventorship and the White House's Champions of Change for
his work on Deaf education.
